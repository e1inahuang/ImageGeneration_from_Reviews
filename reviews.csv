The sunglasses stay on securely with magnets yet they're very easy to remove and install; not sure I'm going to use them very often, but it seems like a nice option to have (would really be great for someone who wears glasses for vision). The rechargeable battery is great also and the charge port is extremely easy to access.

"Oct 24, 2020","Herman Zulu","4 out of 5 stars review","Reasonable helmet. Light, but feels reasonably sturdy. I don't find it so comfortable or secure on my head, doesn't seem to fit my head shape. On the other hand, OH finds it ok for him. Comes with a bag to store it in. Goggles and visor are not attached on arrival but easy to do so. You don't have to have either on; can have none, one or both. I'm not sure the visor would stand up to being put on and off a lot, so best to pick on or off and leave it so. The goggles hold on a lot firmer than I thought they would even though they're held on with magnets. Because of where they're held on the helmet, you can actually wear glasses at the same time which is a bonus. However, I don't find the goggles are in a good position really, seem too high up and don't fully cover my glasses; it's good if you have your head down and just use your eyes to look up as they offer sun protection, but it just feels a little odd. OH didn't mind so much (doesn't wear glasses), so maybe it's just me, or the way it sits on my head!

I think it's a pretty good and convenience design for people who wear glasses like myself. I don't like bringing an extra pair of sunglasses when I bike, so this helmet solves that problem. I can use the goggle as a my sunglasses, and I can use flip it around and stick it on the helmet when I'm not using it.Second, I like the build-in light at the back of the helmet. It has several setting and is USB rechargeable. It's build-in, so i have one less thing to worry about. I can just grab the helmet and go biking.Lastly, the overall design looks good. And I like the padding on the straps. It makes it more comfortable to wear.Cons: just one thing I can complain about and it's the tightening knot at the back of the helmet. It's too close to the helmet so it's a little hard to turn it.

"Apr 16, 2022","Juanita Hauck","5 out of 5 stars review","I ride three or four times a week for at least 1.5 hours in the sunny Mojave desert area and needed something that would protect my head/block some sun and still let me wear my glasses. This fit the bill perfectly. The helmet is adjustable and the sun shield doesn't touch my nose or rub my face at any time but gives me a clear view with good sun protection. The shield is held on by magnets but it's strong and has never once come off while riding over bumps at higher speed. It's very comfortable. I kept the bag the shield came in and use it to store the sun shield when riding at night. I've used the light on the back a few times when night riding and it's nice to have solid/flashing/flashing faster options and have yet to charge the battery. A great buy that I'm happy I found it.","Very Comfy and Great Sun Protection","Review from","victgoal.com"

"Nov 14, 2020","Stacy Murray","5 out of 5 stars review","A lot of additional attachments for a helmet at this price I think it provides great value for money. This helmet on its own is shaped as standard with many airvents and a wide fit. The adjustments will ensure that it will fit most head shapes but I think it is a little more suited to wide heads.The LED lights at the back are a great idea and help you stay seen even when away from your bike. The best thing is that the lights on this helmet are rechargable unlike other ones which take batteries. This makes life much easier and using the lights less of a hassle. There is also a visor which attaches magnetically onto the helmet. The attachments are very strong and I don't see it falling off accidently. This can be very useful if you wear glasses and it starts to rain but also if you cycle in very windy conditions and helps you breathe better. If there is a lot of sun this can keep your face protected which tends to be out all throughout the ride.A great helmet suited for a variety of conditions and provides some nice attachments for individual preference. The rechargeable lights are a great addition too!","Clever design which does not compromise the basic designs.","Review from","victgoal.com"

"Sep 26, 2021","Gussie Hayes","5 out of 5 stars review","When i received the package i thought it was a bit light. The package and contents was noticably lighter than my current helmet. The fit is comfortable, better than my previous helmet. The chin strap is ok. Like others said it kind of buckles more to one side. Doesn't bother me at all while wearing it.The visor just snaps on with these small plastic pieces. The same way most visors i have seen attach. I don't think it would last long if you removed and put back on often.There dark shade had a magnetic attachment. No issue putting on or removing. Easy to remove while riding and can flip it upside down and reattach to essentially remove the shade from your vision. Only issue i found is that the shade sits very close to your face. There is little room for wearing eye glasses underneath. I had one smaller pair of glasses that fit if i move the helmet to a certain position. The shades need to sit very close to your nose when wearing eye glasses. I am a little worried the shade my scratch my glasses. Did find that it didn't move while riding on a 20 mile trip. This is not the best helmet for those wearing eyeglasses. It can work but it's a very close fit. The shade is much larger than it needs to be. It would be better if it was a little shorter and also a little further out from the helmet.One other note, the shade is not dark enough for a bright sunny day. I find i need to wear sunglasses in addition to the shade. The shade is better than nothing but not enough. But the shade does block side glare and top glare.The visor and shade can be used at the same time but then there is no place to store the shade when it's is not needed. My previous helmet has a visor and i noticed this helmet with only the shade on is noticably more streamline. The visor caused some drag, especially when looking to the side.","VICTGOAL Bike Helmet with USB light","Review from","victgoal.com"

"Nov 30, 2019","Garret Zemlak","4 out of 5 stars review","Could immediately tell from the pics that I'd like the looks. And was not disappointed with the style. Buying this online, I was a bit concerned about the one-size-fits-all helmet. I have a big noggin...and was afraid it might be too snug. But I love the fit. If you have a small or medium sized head, you might want/need to wear a head liner underneath or simply pull the chin strap a little tighter. I have a small nose which almost touches the goggles. It doesn't bother me. But if your facial features resemble those of Pinocchio, you should take this into consideration.I've had this for three weeks now. It's Thanksgiving time and autumn is turning into winter. Riding at 70 degrees, riding with the helmet on was perfect. However now that the tempuratures are dipping into the low 40s, my eyes start to water after riding just a mile or so. If I pulled my helmet off immediately after a ride, you'd have thought my dog just died!At any rate, note the visor doesn't wrap all the way around and lets in air around the temple area on both sides. I cut some thin rubber in a trapezoidal shape to fill this area (about 3"" x 1""). My five-mile rides to/from work are much more bearable now.Although this didn't affect my rating, it'd be nice to have two sets of goggles (one tinted, the other clear)..so we could ride with confidence day and night, even if it would be a few bucks more.","Overall A Great Value","Review from","victgoal.com"
"May 13, 2022","Jeanette  Manuel","3 out of 5 stars review","I purchased the VICTGOAL Bike Helmet with the hope of not having to wear sunglasses underneath the wind shield. The good news is that there is enough room to wear a pair of sunglasses underneath. The bad news is that there is so much room on the sides that you have to wear sunglasses underneath to keep the wind out of your eyes. I returned it. I gave it 3 stars because I liked the fluorescent green color and I liked that it came with a light in the back although the light is not really that bright but I guess it is better than not having any light at all.","Not really what I was looking for.","Review from","victgoal.com"

I wear glasses which makes it an even tighter fit. But the way it sticks on with magnets is a good design choice. I can see the benefit during light rain or snow which hampers my visibility.

If there's no place to store it you might as well just use sunglasses since they can be stored easier when not needed.

It fits about a size smaller, but I didn't play with the adjustment much. I decided early on I was returning the helmet for the cheaper and better rated Schwin. I can add my own rear light.

"Sep 10, 2020","Devante Batz","5 out of 5 stars review","The helmet, removable visor and magnetic goggles arrived two days after ordered as promised. Packaging was in perfect condition. I was kind of leery of the goggles because I had never tried on a helmet that had them. I was very pleasantly surprised at the unimpeded vision I had. The goggles have a very nice smokey tint and had good glare reduction as well. I also had concerns about the goggles being held on by magnets but I popped them , very easy by the way, and proceeded to shake my head like a madman. They didn't budge. Using the adjustable sizing knob I was able to get a perfect fit for my slightly larger than average head (no comments from the peanut gallery!). It is very light and comfortable. The removable/washable liner is a definite plus. The fact that the rear of the helmet extends further down than a lot of others is nice and it also adds to the protection factor. The helmet has very good ventilation which is very important to me as I live in south Florida. The only drawback, although no biggy, is with the chin strap adjuster. I had to play with it a little but got it adjusted fine. The USB rechargeable rear multi-function light is cool and makes you much more visible to traffic than just having a tail light down under your saddle. I did notice that the light was beginning to come out of the helmet when I pulled it out of the box. I had read a couple of reviews that mentioned this issue but it was very easily negated by simply wedging a couple pieces of wire tie ends I cut on the sides of the light which cannot be seen at all once the light is in place. The included storage pouch is also pretty cool. I shopped all over the web looking for a helmet in the $50 +/- range and this one was my clear winner. Highly recommended.","Look cool even if your old!!!","Review from","victgoal.com"
"Jun 6, 2021","Esta Kawuki","4 out of 5 stars review","My helmet arrived a little late, other than that I have no gripes about this product. This helmet is great. Very comfortable due to the nice padded liner. Fit is as close to perfect as it gets. Nice padded chinstrap. This is probably the most well ventilated cycling helmet I've ever owned. Even when pushing hard on mixed terrain on the gravel bike on a hot day it keeps my dome cool. I love that the built in safety light is USB rechargeable. A big selling point for me was the removable sun visor as I will be using it as both a road and mountain bike helmet. I also love the sun goggle as I wear prescription lenses but like to wear sunglasses when on the bike, but can't see as well as I would like when I switch from my specs to sunglasses. The goggle allows me to wear my glasses underneath so I can see clearly. I am very impressed with the quality of this helmet at this price point. In short. I love this helmet.","Quality build.

It's easily adjusted, is comfortable, has the removable visor and goggles and a rear light with 3 settings. For me, besides safety, one of my favorite features is the magnetic goggles. The magnets are stronger than I expected and I like that they are a bit further from my eyes than sunglasses. At the same time, my eyes are protected from bugs or any other minor debris. The light is higher on the rear rather than at the base making it more visible.

"Nov 17, 2020","Rebekah Kerluke","5 out of 5 stars review","I like this helmet. It feels sturdy, well made and is especially well ventilated to avoid a hot, sweaty head and 'helmet hair' by providing a good airflow through the helmet while out on the road. I also found it lighter in weight than my previous helmet and in the low autumnal sun I found the clip-on peak to be at just the right angle when pedalling into the setting sun while, in strong headwinds the snap-on magnetic visor kept the wind out of my eyes and preventing them from streaming - which is a daily problem for me on chilly morning rides.The interior is well padded and the entire padding with insect net are removable for washing (much better than lining it with kitchen roll!). There were no parts which chaffed and I found it completely comfortable on full-day rides of +50 miles. Fit-wise it is marginally too large. Although sized at 57-62cm and having a 57cm head - it was just slightly looser than I would have liked but soon resolved by adding a few extra padding strips or, as I did initially, wearing a this skull-cap beneath it for protection from autumnal wind and rain.As for styling, I like this too. The rear has a good overhang from my head to give good protection in the event of an accident and a further excellent safety feature is the rear lamp with its 3 modes (static red, flashing red and slow-fading/flashing red) which those cycling behind me reassured me was highly visible in dusk and complete darkness. This is rechargeable via USB and on is flashing modes lasted a good 3 hours before returning home to recharge it. After using this, I would always now look for this feature on any future helmets - although I doubt I'll need to replace this for some time.I was pleased to see a CE stamp (hopefully genuine), conformance to EN1078 and a CPSC accredited testing stickers.I am very happy with this helmet which has now become my daily helmet.","Comfy, very well ventilated, feels safe and secure","Review from","victgoal.com"

I also really like the detachable windshield for the eyes. the instructions on how to attach and detach is very clear. the windscreen also blocks out their sun. which works great as a shades on sunny days. the red light on the back of the helmet is also very handy it has three different settings which is great depending on where you are biking as it saves the taillights for cycling.Overall I am very happy with the product and would recommend if you're looking for a good quality light weight biking helmet for a good price.","good quality lightweight bike helmet","Review from","victgoal.com"

Helmet feels heavy compared to my other name brand one. Lite only lasts a few rides(20 miles or so) then it needs to be charged. I do like keeping the sun off my face.

The led on the back is a plus, although when in riding position this is pointed more at the sky than behind you. This helmet looks and feels like it would provide reasonable protection in a crash.I like the idea of the visor, but the gray tint is pretty dark and I wouldn't use it except in direct sunlight. I bought the yellow tinted one separately, which works on cloudy days and even at night. The notch for your nose on both visors was too small for me and I had to use a hobby knife to keep them from riding on my nose. No matter which of my three pairs of glasses I wear, the inside of the visor presses against them lightly, kind of annoying, but not so bad as to make the visor unusable. The assist on my ebike cuts out at 28 mph, so I generally move along pretty quick when I am riding, and the visors really help cut down on eye watering and keep bugs off of the upper half of my face. I just wish the visor setup was designed better, so that it wouldn't press against my nose and glasses.","Nice helmet","Review from","victgoal.com"

Rear light is a nice touch and reassuring back up to bike lights. USB rechargeable light comes with usb cable. Manual included for fitting and maintaining, also has a carry bag.

"May 14, 2022","Akunna Yussuf","2 out of 5 stars review","Their fit guide is very misleading. I guess they just measured the circumference of the helmet and posted it. The problem is that people's heads come in different shapes. Unless your head has the exact shape as the helmet, it may not fit into the helmet even if its circumference falls right in the middle of the claimed range. They did post the width of the helmet to be 7 in / 18 cm, which could have solved the problem. However, if you don't want your head to be squeezed, that width should be 6.3 in / 16 cm, much smaller than the 7 in / 18 cm as they claimed.I give 2 stars instead of 1 because the design with the magnetic goggle is cool.

The gray googles may interfere with some polarized eyeglasses but overall they are very good for reducing glare. By not using the included black visor you can conveniently store the goggles reversed in the ""up"" position for when you don't need them. When buying extra goggles (yellow, clear, etc.) note that VG sells two styles which are not interchangeable. The rechargeable rear light changes from red to green when fully charged. The helmet straps tend to loosen over time but tacking them in place with a stitch or two with thread fixes the problem easily.

"Aug 27, 2020","Rafaela Moore","5 out of 5 stars review","I needed a new helmet and liked the idea of getting one with 1-a built in rear blinker, and 2-a visor. I LOVE having the visor because it keeps the knats from getting in my eyes. They used to get around my sun glasses and get stuck in my eye. I had to stop, take off my helmet and gloves, and flush the bug out with water from my water bottle (probably not the best thing to use with backwash, but better than sticking my fingers in my eyes). I have had the helmet for about 3 weeks now and here it is in the height of bug season, and no more knats in my eyes. I think the visor actually creates a wind current around my face that pretty much deflects the bugs away because I have had fewer bugs in my mouth and nose as well. I ride 165 miles a week and probably at least half of that is through an area that is along a river (so lots more bugs!). The visor does scratch VERY easily though, so when you pop it off you have to be very careful not to drop it.The battery recharges really quickly (2 hours or less) and lasts for at least 2 rides (I alternate 30 miles/2.5 hrs one day and 25 miles/2 hrs the next) with enough juice to last if I end up getting sidetracked. I haven't tried seeing if it would last 3 days but I think it would last at least part way through the third.The helmet is comfortable and adjusted easily. The plastic coating does seem a little thinner than my old Bell helmet, but isn't it the foam that really absorbs the impact? It seems to come down a little farther on the back of my head because I have to secure my pony tail lower down than with my last helmet --- a good thing. I wish I had this 2 months ago when I wrecked and got thrown into a gate made of 2"" diameter pipe that hit just below the edge of my helmet.

I have several helmets, some popular brands and some inexpensive china models. This one is the best among all of them. This one feels more substantial, and the visor and the goggles are cool. When I first got this I did not put the visor on and I used it for my road bike. It looks good and I wore it for several hundred miles. Then I bought a new helmet to use for my road bike (a more expensive helmet from a popular brand) and I gotta say that this helmet is nicer. However since I have that other helmet for my road bike, I put the visor on this one and now use it for my Mountain bike. It looks great and is still my favorite of all the helmets I have.

It just slides on and always feels secure.Back light in the helmet is a neat idea but I have continuosly forgotten to charge it, getting the helmet to a charger is not always convenient. The on off button for the light has no tactile feedback so you've no idea whether you managed to turn it on. Or off.The visor was the main reason I bought this but it fogs up almost immediately of you go indoors. You can remove the visor bit the very first thing I did was lose it. I bought the clear plastic variation too, both fog with a face mask. You can rock the helmet back on your head a little but you will still struggle to see indoors if wearing a mask that covers your nose.I love this helmet for the comfort and would recommend on that basis.

It adjusts very well, and the chin strap is as comfortable as one can be. Color is bright, but already fading after 2 months of use (100 miles per week), enough that I believe it will be nearly white by one year (similar to other safety yellow helmets I've owned).BIG PROBLEM - the light charges well still in the helmet, but can be removed if needed. It always felt like it was snapped in tight, but after 3 months it fell out somewhere along the road, and I have been unable to find it again. Now I have a gaping hole in the back of my helmet that no other light will fit. I have not seen where it can be purchased separately.","great helmet, but loose light","Review from","victgoal.com"
"Feb 19, 2021","Eva Palmer","3 out of 5 stars review","I have attached rear lights to my bike helmets for years. I was ready for a new helmet, and thought that the long-lasting built-in light with this helmet would be wonderful. As with most bikers, 99% of my miles are in daylight Unfortunately, the light is so dim during the day that there is virtually no chance of gaining the driver's attention beyond 100 yards.....which is not enough for safety. Otherwise, the helmet has good fit and adjustability. I purchased it in bright yellow, which is otherwise good for visibility. I have purchased a CygoLite 200 Lumen light to attach, which has turned this into a $75 helmet/light combo. Just too bad the Victgoal does not contain a viable rear light....even a 25 lumen blinkie would change my rating to 5-stars.","Built-In Light is Dismal for Daytime Biking","Review from","victgoal.com"
"Oct 24, 2020","Lora Kabuye","5 out of 5 stars review","This is a great helmet which comes well accessorized. In the box is:HelmetDetachable one-piece gogglesDetachable sun visorUSB charging cableCarry bagPaperworkThe helmet itself is very cool in it's on-trend matt black finish with white flashes and even hi-viz detailing on the straps. Being a bit of a visibility nerd though I...  l probably further snazz it up with some high viz tape. Talking of which, I absolutely love the rear light. It's built in so no chance of losing it and it has three modes in use. Comfort is great with it being light and sturdy but also fully adjustable and there is also some padding on the chin strap which is most welcome. The manufacturers have obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this item.The sun visor completes the MTB look (if desired) but the one-piece magnetic goggle is a fabulous feature giving you further eye protection and the full-on TT/Robocop profile with great eye protection at just the right distance from your face. It is a doddle to put on and pull off one-handed though I am a little concerned it may come off when going over big bumps. Not happened yet though and so far I am very impressed with this item that also represents excellent value for money.","Fully featured and well made helmet","Review from","victgoal.com"
"Dec 13, 2020","Eugene Mwesigye","5 out of 5 stars review","I have been really impressed with this helmet, and the attachable visor feature is superbWhen in use, the helmet is comfortable and lightweight and very easy to adjust. The small peak at the front is makes it more like a ""mountain bike"" helmet for than a standard ""rounded street bike"" helmet and adds a bit of character to the helmet itself. There are decent vents of the top to generate a cool ""airy"" feeling when worn and the black effect is very stylish. However the real gem on this helmet is the attachable front visor which acts like sunglasses and is superb to wear on bright sunny days. The visor itself offers decent protection against the sunlight but they are not polarized like some others on the market, however they do offer UV protection.Overall this is a great helmet in terms of comfort, style and functionality with the visor option and at this price offers superb value for money too - I would certainly recommended!","A great summer helmet with the visor!","Review from","victgoal.com"

It is way more comfortable then I thought, regardless of it being hard like other helmets. It just fit my head way better. The straps are strong and can be adjusted easily to keep it nice and tight.I have not set up a front headlight on it but I may later on.

I can never find baseball caps in my size but this helmet came in my size and I really enjoyed it a lot that I bought another one with different colors to give to my bicycle buddy. My favorite part about this helmet is the magnetic shades. I was going to buy bicycle glasses but now that it comes with the magnetic visor I don't need goggles or glasses the shield on the helmet works great.","No tools required to set this up","Review from","victgoal.com"
"Nov 5, 2020","Tarun Gagrani","5 out of 5 stars review","Good helmet, very comfortable with the inner net cushion, I have a big head and it fits fine and feels good.The helmet looks good and feels quite solid and lightweight. The sun visor clips on and I think makes it look better so I leave it on all the time, it can pop of again with a tug if you want to.The eye protection is very good, it attaches by magnets that look like press studs and they are strong enough to hold it in place with the vibrations and if I knock it when moving the helmet on my head. They come down and cover you peripheral vision as well so you don't get wind in your eyes, they work better than sunglasses.The red light at the back is a good touch and adds some safety and it's easily recharged with the usb lead. You also get a carry bag and a snood as well.Not the cheapest helmet but it's made well and I'm pleased with it.","Comfortable, good magnetic sun glasses and good rear light","Review from","victgoal.com"
