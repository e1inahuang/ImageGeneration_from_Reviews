"Stylish helmet, enjoy the goggles keeps road grime and wind on the eyes. The addition of the rear safety light great idea."
"Bike helmet fits excellent, well  worth the price!
The padding fits great and adjusting to fit is easy."
visor was kind of hard to put on.but light works good.fit was kinda hard to do.but i got it.nice helmet
"Comfortable fit, light weight.  The sun visor is a life saver as i tend to sweat a lot and wearing normal sunglasses while biking gets irritating as i have to clean them costantly."
Amazing! Adjusts for perfect fit by turning a simple knob in the back! Light is awesome with multiple settings. Mask detaches and attaches easily. This helmet has it all!
"First off, the color is awesome. It is one size adjustable. Neck strap is comfortable.  The magnetic shade is excellent too. Rear red rechargable helmet light is awesome too. price is great as well. I wear this helmet everytime i am out on my ebike. i highly recommend it."
"I already said but the middle piece was VERY hard to snap in, I almost gave up. also, I put in for a return/refund but says I have to take it to a Walmart, I DON'T HAVE A CAR!"
Can't get the sun visor to stay on. The magnetic eye shade curls so far back its riding on and irritating the bridge of your nose. The chin strap won't stay snug where you want it. Overall the helmet is very uncomfortable and particularly so in the back where the light is. Total waste of money. I bought another new helmet which works and just threw this one away
"Victgoal material arrived damaged. The Victgoal helmet is heavy %26 very disconfortable to wear. Victgoal is expensive too. 
Victgoal  has the worest customer service.
Victgoal refunds with Paypal.
Be aware-Buy from somewhere else. Or  buy from local stores. Don't buy Victgoal."

"fits well, comfortable,good quality 
I love the fact that it has a light on the back of the helmet. money well spent thank you."
"adjust for any size by a simple turn of a dial, even while wearing. I love the magnetic sun shield"
Great light on the back to let others know that you are biking. Comfortable and well put together
Open the package grandson  does not want to wear the helmet.
Very comfortable easy to customize the fit. Made well
Great quality and appearance

"Nice helmet, goog quality"

Love the color and the cool features!
"Nice! Versatile, looks good, feels good, and light!"
"Fits well, looks good. Thank you."
love the light on the back of the helmet.
"color is nice, fits perfectly and comes with a eyeshield"
Great quality and exactly what I need it
Best product light weight and easy to fit
I am completely satisfied with my helmet  .
"It was just as it looked, very nice helmet"
Great helmet. came in a great time.
It is well built and fits perfectly. The accessories are easy to use.
fits very comfortably. visor shades wonderfully
Excellent stylish and comfortable bike helmet at a very affordable price.
"Very comfortable, fits is good and lightweight. Adjustable and vents."
Looks great and fits perfect! Would recommend. The light in the back is great.
Excellent quality. Stylish while keeping you safe. Charging is easy and the magnets work perfectly.
The helmet was easy to adjust to fit. Really like the front shield.  My wife likes the way the back light flashs.
visibility is great.
Not too bad
"No assembly instructions visor snaps on goggles magnetic mounts. All in all great bike helmet I like the way it looks. Safety light for night, visor and goggles sunlight. Well vented for our flow. Excellent if you're safety conches bike rider with an aggressive style."
"You should have a more accurate idea of your available stock. When you over sell to make sure you get the most, you do a disservice to your customers. Now I don't get my item, and I get to wait 10 days for my refund. Imagine the interest you can make on thousands of unfulfilled orders."
"I love this Helmet. I am 6'4'' tall with a weight mass of 240lbs and when I was online searching for this Helmet, the description said adjustable to fit all. Well that absolutely correct.  All descriptions of this Helmet are absolutely correct.
Some was selling this Helmet around $70 not including tax and shipping fees, thanks Walmart."
"I've only used this once so far, but I can't find anything that would be considered a con or negative which is the best thing about it. It feels great and fits perfect without moving around; I've never had a helmet with such a great fit. It shipped free via Fedex and was delivered 14 hours after I made the purchase; not sure how that was possible. The visor clicks on easily. The sunglasses stay on securely with magnets yet they're very easy to remove and install; not sure I'm going to use them very often, but it seems like a nice option to have (would really be great for someone who wears glasses for vision). The rechargeable battery is great also and the charge port is extremely easy to access. The light isn't particularly bright, but it should be effective at night when you need it; it isn't going to help in daylight. This is really a well thought out product at a great value for the money."
"This helmet seems to be of pretty good quality.  It fits nicely and has enough adjustments.  The magnetic visor is new for me and I am still learning to use it.  I think it will be something that I'll like once I get accustomed to it.  I have always worn sunglasses to ride so the visor is nice to have for wind protection for my eyes.  I had used my old helmet for 14 years and red that they should be replaced after 5, so that was my motivation."
I found every feature of this helmet more than met my expectations. Only wish I could wear my glasses under the clear magnetic eye visors but this proved to be a negotiable  inconvenience. They cut down on the sun's glear like a good pair of sunglasses. I very much liked the flashing light on the rear of the helmet that added to my visibility while riding at night.
Freaking awesome helmet! Magnetic goggles snap on and snap off like magic. Rear tail light USB rechargeable on back of helmet. Cool style and well ventilated. Made from quality material. Would pay double the price if I ever had to replace it. One of the very best items I've ever bought.
"Although marketed as an ""adult"" sized helmet which will fit up to 24"", this helmet is clearly marked ""M"" and ""Medium"". Adjusted to the maximum, it barely fit my 23"" head, snuggly.

The visor sits too low, causing the wearer to crane their head uncomfortably upward to see out from under it.

The goggles rub uncomfortably on the bridge of my nose which is not large, They aren't wearable without modification.

The light seems to work fine."
Not many helmets have a shield. This worked well for a person who wears glasses. I got the adult L size. Better to have head room rather than be to tight. I wished it had the option of a clear shield.  This site has this for $20 less than the actual brand site. js I went to the brand site and got a clear shield :-)
"It's got a good Fit, The Googles work great for riding on Shaded Trails. it keeps insects and direct wind out of my eyes, Googles are easy to remove for cleaning. When wearing the helmet  googles are about a ¼” above my nose. The Visor works good to put more air into the helmet."
I feel like I'm a Tour de France rider wearing this helmet I love the adjustable settings it's super easy and the magnetic visor stays on with some very strong magnets. Also the light on the back last a long time and is rechargeable very easy and one of the best helmets I've owned
The order I'm sure is lost. It keeps saying it's delayed and on its way.
Helmet just as described. I love it!
"Nice helmet, The visor comes off really easy."
"nifty helmet, really nice visor that attaches magnetically"
"Light weight, yet strong !"
lights on helmet
Great bike helmet
Thank you….nice helmet
"Nice, too small for me"
Great item
Fantastic!
I loved the visor and that it is magnetically attached. I also love the 3 light modes on the back of the helmet that can be cycled through by pressing the button. Looks very cool.
"It feels really comfortable, light but strong. The light has three modes and you can see them clear at a good distance. How good it looks, it's just a neat bonus.  Happy customer"
"Surprising lightweight and functional, love the “safety” light feature on the back.  The magnetic sunshield (visor) is awesome.  Well worth the money."
"Loves his new helmet, adult size gives  him room to grow. The goggles %26 back of helmet with the light with 3 settings is great. Such a safety helmet. Very best purchase."
"Solid Fit. The adjustable headband is the Bomb. Feels secure, doesn't slide around. Rechargeable light, magnetic tinted visor, easy on %26 off. Best bike helmet I've ever had."
"This is my second Helmer, but I'm actually buying it for a friend. I showed him how freaking cool mine was and he had to have one too. It's an incredibly well made helmet and extremely cool looking."
"looks and feels good. I am super excited!
the quality seems good. the functions are great. you can put on and take of the visor easily because it has magnets."
"I like the light on the back of the helmet and the sun visor on the front of the helmet, like that the helmet is light weight and lets a lot of air flow through it."
I like it so much
Saved my life
Excellent head gear
The first one was the wrong color. The replacement arrived severely damaged. I am trying to get a label to return it.
I got this for my son but when it was delivered in was a women's bike helmet.  I will be returning it.
Love the fit and color love the reflective stitching and rear light just don't like that the plug part does not come with the wires.
They are very comfortable and look great. I like that it has the flashing light on the back for night time.g
It fits so well and looks good! Love the shaded shield to protect from bugs and wind buffeting around my eyes! It's truly great!
"I like this helmet. it fits well. light is visible. The eye shield is very handy, would like it if it had a clear one also."
love the helmet good air flow like the light in the back of  the helmet.  light weight. like the visor also.
Great Helmet! Great color! I got the blue with orange trim! Fits well great visor and comfortable!
It is or soon but buy the look it is of good quality. I will keep this review posted.Guedo
Didn't like how crooked the visor fits on the helmet very uneven totally can tell looks terrible
ngwt loads of compliments on this and the battery is still going strong
"it was so fast!
it will be a gift so review will be provided later"
better than quality than what is carried in the stor
I like the USB rechargeable led in the back
As described in description and the light is nice also that's it's rechargeable
Beautiful helmet.  Fits perfectly and looks great
"Love it   Exactly what I paid for. 
 lightweight and breathable"
The helmet fits great like the light feature goggles don't fit over glasses
I like the weight the design the easy accessory assembly and how it feels on my head.
lightweight and fits good
I have a smaller head so could not get the straps comfortable and secure
"I was very disappointed with the process I needed to go through to attach the visor. The pegs on the visor were just too big for the grommets on the helmet. One went in easily, but I needed to use a dremel tool to widen the other two holes. Not the quality I would expect for the price. The helmet should have shipped with the visor attached."
"Love this helmet comfortable, light weight and I unfortunately put it to a test this morning I flipped my bike crossing a railroad track (@ about 16mph) on a paved road. The helmet did exactly what it was supposed to! I didn't realize my head had hit the ground because the helmet took the impact. Only when I inspected the helmet I realized how hard I hit."
This helmet is very comfortable to wear and doesn't feel top heavy at all. It's worth every penny and the sun visor is perfect by itself. What makes this helmet worth it is the visor has plenty of room for sun glasses if you want to wear them. Highly recommended if you're looking for a great helmet.
"Perfect worth the money, but I'd advise to by multiple visors the night (yellow) and clear ones in particular. I found the standard one that comes with is near useless in terms of visibility at dawn(had to take it off) overall durable and will do a job whatever bike you decide to ride will it be a racer or mountain bike."
"I bought 2 of these... each arrived as if it had already been dropped or scraped.. the paint was blemished out of the box. I returned both fearing if it was this delicate already (new) it wouldn't look great after wearing it a few weeks.REVISED RATINGthe seller reached out to me and was very concerned about my issues I was having with my previous orders. They made sure to send me a helmet without blemishes and followed up to make sure I was happy with my purchase. I ended up buy an additional helmet (same seller and brand) and it too came flawless. I do recommend this seller and this product. If it does come damaged, they will make it right!"
"Bought this as a replacement to my old helmet that sacrificed itself while doing its job when I was sideswiped by a MGIF idiot car driver.Only used it once so far. It's very stiff, even the interior padding, it's not as comfortable as my old helmet and the airflow wasn't as good, I sweated - a lot and this was during a ride at 6am on a January morning where the temperature was 1 degree. Time will tell but if it remains like this I can't see myself using it when the weather gets warmer."
Love this helmet lightweight comfortable Love the visor and the USB rechargeable light on the back of the helmet so there is no battery replacement if you use the light. It comes with a magnetic goggle to attach which works great for attaching and removing easily it said you could flip the goggles upside down if you wanted to not stop using it but keep it on the helmet I have not figured out how to do that with the visor in place. Highly recommend this helmet it has all the bells and whistles.
"I really like this product. The quick click sun glass is really cool it holds tight during ride but can be pull off with ease. Led light in back work well, nice and bright with multiple settings(I use the blinking one). Very light feeling. I really have enjoyed this helmet."
"Looks great.I don't use the visor as it is not practical for me.USB-Rechargeable light is a bonus. Although the light is not visible during the day, at night it is probably visible for 20 feet . So don't rely on that for safety, use a powerful tail light (which typically cost more than this whole helmet.)"
"I really like this helmet, the fit is perfect and the visors clip in place magnetically they are secure and are just plain great. I ordered extra visors in case they get scratched and thay will. All visors of this type will get scrathed. My favorite visor I have is the multy colored one. Sure the light in the back of the helmet isn't very bright but big deal, you shouldn't rely on just that light. Any seasoned biker knows you need more than one light on the back of your bike. Anyway I gave it five stars because it deserves it especially for the price."
"Reasonable helmet. Light, but feels reasonably sturdy. I don't find it so comfortable or secure on my head, doesn't seem to fit my head shape. On the other hand, OH finds it ok for him. Comes with a bag to store it in. Goggles and visor are not attached on arrival but easy to do so. You don't have to have either on; can have none, one or both. I'm not sure the visor would stand up to being put on and off a lot, so best to pick on or off and leave it so. The goggles hold on a lot firmer than I thought they would even though they're held on with magnets. Because of where they're held on the helmet, you can actually wear glasses at the same time which is a bonus. However, I don't find the goggles are in a good position really, seem too high up and don't fully cover my glasses; it's good if you have your head down and just use your eyes to look up as they offer sun protection, but it just feels a little odd. OH didn't mind so much (doesn't wear glasses), so maybe it's just me, or the way it sits on my head! Padded chin strap and rechargeable light with variable light pattern on the back of the helmet (small charging lead included). Easily adjustable for a range of head sizes."
"First of all, what catches my attention was detachable google of this helmet. I think it's a pretty good and convenience design for people who wear glasses like myself. I don't like bringing an extra pair of sunglasses when I bike, so this helmet solves that problem. I can use the goggle as a my sunglasses, and I can use flip it around and stick it on the helmet when I'm not using it.Second, I like the build-in light at the back of the helmet. It has several setting and is USB rechargeable. It's build-in, so i have one less thing to worry about. I can just grab the helmet and go biking.Lastly, the overall design looks good. And I like the padding on the straps. It makes it more comfortable to wear.Cons: just one thing I can complain about and it's the tightening knot at the back of the helmet. It's too close to the helmet so it's a little hard to turn it. I think a simple redesign can fix this problem, and makes it even better"
"This helmet is very light and comfortable. It is easily adjustable. The light works very well and is bright. The option of the visor is great and the magnetic goggles are really cool! They work very well. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase!"
"I have a small head for a bloke, headphones are almost always set to the minimum possible size.This helmet fits quite snuggly at its tightest fitting, but the chin straps are quite loose. I can tighten them but they dig in to my chin.I bought this during lockdown when the shops wouldn't let you try helmets on.This helmet is ok, the light is a nice addition and the shades are super cool! But I wouldn't have bought it if I tried it on in a shop beforehand. I kept it though, cos like I say, it's ok"
Great quality helmet. Sturdy but light weight. Detachable visor is a great idea for sunny days especially as I wear glasses. Magnets that hold the visor are really strong so it stays secure whilst riding. No fear of it dropping off. Rear light is also a great addition for safety.
This is a nice comfortable helmet. Good adjustment control makes it easy to adjust fit. I got the hi viz yellow. Surprised with the great optical quality of the visor. I also got the yellow visor for night riding. Haven't been out after dark yet so can't comment on the built in tail light yet but it's not very noticeable in daylight. I'm going to enjoy this helmet!
I ride three or four times a week for at least 1.5 hours in the sunny Mojave desert area and needed something that would protect my head/block some sun and still let me wear my glasses. This fit the bill perfectly. The helmet is adjustable and the sun shield doesn't touch my nose or rub my face at any time but gives me a clear view with good sun protection. The shield is held on by magnets but it's strong and has never once come off while riding over bumps at higher speed. It's very comfortable. I kept the bag the shield came in and use it to store the sun shield when riding at night. I've used the light on the back a few times when night riding and it's nice to have solid/flashing/flashing faster options and have yet to charge the battery. A great buy that I'm happy I found it.
"Taking one star off as the connection between the visor and the helmet could be studier, like the older one I had from a more established brand. but the magnetic sun shade is really cool. doubles as a wind goggles. I would be first in line to buy a clear one as goggles for cloudy days. wish the company would have it as an option. they could even offer different colors."
"Great helmet , fits nice, light on the back is good size and bright, shame delivery took so long due to wrong address being put on packing & small scratches on the visor right in eyes view, no point in sending back as I doubt another would be delivered correctly"
"Well made helmet, attractive, light weight, comfortable, bought this one because of the sun shield. It works great. I feel it puts me in my own world especially with head phones. Love it. Helps to keep the bugs off your face and probably if I get caught in the rain some day it will come in handy, comes right off if I don't want it on. Incognito profile."
A lot of additional attachments for a helmet at this price I think it provides great value for money. This helmet on its own is shaped as standard with many airvents and a wide fit. The adjustments will ensure that it will fit most head shapes but I think it is a little more suited to wide heads.The LED lights at the back are a great idea and help you stay seen even when away from your bike. The best thing is that the lights on this helmet are rechargable unlike other ones which take batteries. This makes life much easier and using the lights less of a hassle. There is also a visor which attaches magnetically onto the helmet. The attachments are very strong and I don't see it falling off accidently. This can be very useful if you wear glasses and it starts to rain but also if you cycle in very windy conditions and helps you breathe better. If there is a lot of sun this can keep your face protected which tends to be out all throughout the ride.A great helmet suited for a variety of conditions and provides some nice attachments for individual preference. The rechargeable lights are a great addition too!
"This bicycle helmet is great for the time trialist, As it has a very big magnetic visor shield covering my eyes. It looks like it is made of good quality materials, And will last a really long time.The helmet is a bit chunky, So fans of more slimline helmets may not like it as much, But it does feel very safe, And the backlight adds extra precautions when riding during the night.The helmet's retention system is quite nice and snug, And would suit both beginners or pro's alike."
This was a gift for my brother who needed a new helmet and does a lot of biking on city streets. This is sturdy but lightweight and has great safety lighting. He also really likes the detachable visor and sun shield. It looks cool too! We likened it to something we might've seen in Robocop. :)
The helmet over all is great. It did take 5 weeks for delivery. The finish is the metal blue with white trim and is flawless. You can see in the attached photo that my glasses fit behind face shield nicely. Also I've included a picture of the usb cable for light charging which they do send with helmet.
I'm very happy with this helmet. For the price of the helmet I was very surprised with how comfortable it is and how many cool features that it has. The best part of it is the lens that connects to the front via magnets. I even ordered a clear version of the lens for night riding. The rear of the head coverage is good and I feel that it'll protect when needed. I would buy this helmet again if I had to.
"When i received the package i thought it was a bit light. The package and contents was noticably lighter than my current helmet. The fit is comfortable, better than my previous helmet. The chin strap is ok. Like others said it kind of buckles more to one side. Doesn't bother me at all while wearing it.The visor just snaps on with these small plastic pieces. The same way most visors i have seen attach. I don't think it would last long if you removed and put back on often.There dark shade had a magnetic attachment. No issue putting on or removing. Easy to remove while riding and can flip it upside down and reattach to essentially remove the shade from your vision. Only issue i found is that the shade sits very close to your face. There is little room for wearing eye glasses underneath. I had one smaller pair of glasses that fit if i move the helmet to a certain position. The shades need to sit very close to your nose when wearing eye glasses. I am a little worried the shade my scratch my glasses. Did find that it didn't move while riding on a 20 mile trip. This is not the best helmet for those wearing eyeglasses. It can work but it's a very close fit. The shade is much larger than it needs to be. It would be better if it was a little shorter and also a little further out from the helmet.One other note, the shade is not dark enough for a bright sunny day. I find i need to wear sunglasses in addition to the shade. The shade is better than nothing but not enough. But the shade does block side glare and top glare.The visor and shade can be used at the same time but then there is no place to store the shade when it's is not needed. My previous helmet has a visor and i noticed this helmet with only the shade on is noticably more streamline. The visor caused some drag, especially when looking to the side."
"Strange to buy a helmet with a dark visor & light on the back ?I bought this helmet & a clear visor for my daily commute to work thinking about keeping some of the rain & maybe snow when it comes out of my face.So far I've found I'm getting more wind blowing up my visor & into my eyes, maybe it's something I can live with or alter in some way?The magnetic visor system is good & holds it well.However the helmet is stylish & fits well & the rear led light is really good with 3 settings.Overall great for the price."
"Could immediately tell from the pics that I'd like the looks. And was not disappointed with the style. Buying this online, I was a bit concerned about the one-size-fits-all helmet. I have a big noggin...and was afraid it might be too snug. But I love the fit. If you have a small or medium sized head, you might want/need to wear a head liner underneath or simply pull the chin strap a little tighter. I have a small nose which almost touches the goggles. It doesn't bother me. But if your facial features resemble those of Pinocchio, you should take this into consideration.I've had this for three weeks now. It's Thanksgiving time and autumn is turning into winter. Riding at 70 degrees, riding with the helmet on was perfect. However now that the tempuratures are dipping into the low 40s, my eyes start to water after riding just a mile or so. If I pulled my helmet off immediately after a ride, you'd have thought my dog just died!At any rate, note the visor doesn't wrap all the way around and lets in air around the temple area on both sides. I cut some thin rubber in a trapezoidal shape to fill this area (about 3"" x 1""). My five-mile rides to/from work are much more bearable now.Although this didn't affect my rating, it'd be nice to have two sets of goggles (one tinted, the other clear)..so we could ride with confidence day and night, even if it would be a few bucks more."
I purchased the VICTGOAL Bike Helmet with the hope of not having to wear sunglasses underneath the wind shield. The good news is that there is enough room to wear a pair of sunglasses underneath. The bad news is that there is so much room on the sides that you have to wear sunglasses underneath to keep the wind out of your eyes. I returned it. I gave it 3 stars because I liked the fluorescent green color and I liked that it came with a light in the back although the light is not really that bright but I guess it is better than not having any light at all.
The helmet fits well and is adjustable. I can wear a hat under it when it's cold. And the visibility is very good when wearing the visor. I haven't used the rear light as I ride only during daylight hours and I have lights on my bike. I recommend the helmet.
"This is the most comfortable helmet I've had. The lining is thick and cushiony. I love that it has the USB-rechargeable back light, which I will use in addition to other blinking lights on my backpack when I commute in the dark.The visor is interesting but is very close to my face. I wear glasses which makes it an even tighter fit. But the way it sticks on with magnets is a good design choice. I can see the benefit during light rain or snow which hampers my visibility. I would prefer that it was clear plastic so that it is easier worn at night."
"I read the reviews and try to be smart when I purchase a product I haven't been able to examine in person. This helmet delivers on value and features. The helmet fits well; the magnetic sun visor works great and is easy to remove and put on; the rechargeable light on the back of the helmet if great for riding in low light. The interior of the helmet has a good amount of cushion and breathable fabric that allows for a constant airflow while riding.Overall, this helmet is a great value and I'm buying another one to give my gf as a present"
This is a really nice helmet. The adjustment disk on the back makes snugging it down or loosening it really easy. Covers the crown of the head unlike some that just sort of rest on top. I REALLY like the magnetic visor/shade. Why don't all helmets come with this? I know wear some cool sunglasses. Well those of us that already wear glasses prefer our own rather than buying separate glasses/contacts etc. The light on the back is a good feature. I have not used the light much to know how long the battery lasts.
"Victpoal has done a great job. Not only is this helmet safe, but it also incorporates a light in the rear of the helmet so that I can be seen by cars coming at me from behind. It gives you the option to select the light: constant, fast flashing, and slow flashing. The light is red when charging via a standard USB. The light changes to green when It has finished charging. I would buy it again."
"Very comfortable to wear, fits around the back of the head more than others. Magnetic visor is great, keeps the cold morning air off of your eyes. Built in light is another great feature. Cannot comment on its crash worthiness yet and hopefully won't ever have to."
Seems good enough. Its comfortable thanks in large part to the adjustment mechanisms. I'm disappointed with the sun visor though since there is no place to store it. Why doesn't it clip onto the back of the helmet. If there's no place to store it you might as well just use sunglasses since they can be stored easier when not needed. Light in the back is a good idea except it's attached to the helmet so you have to have your helmet near your charger ;it would be far better if the light was detachable.
"SummaryThis is a very good helmet which is adjustable and comfortable. Nice touch with the magnetic sun visor too.Look and FeelNice design and available colours with reflective strips. Straps have lots of adjustment with the tightening ratchet at the rear of the helmet and the chin straps adjust too.Sun VisorNice idea for the magnetic sun visor, but if used on a bumpy road and / or a road bike with slim tyres there may be an issue with the visor falling off and with a road bike there would be nowhere to store it - assuming it survived the fall. I have lost a couple of bike lights this way."
"Fit perfect, well made, visor and eye shield very effective against sun and road debri and bugs, neeting keeps out bees. Rechargeable light a nice touch. I replaced my old Victgoal with this new one after a very hard crash. Broken rib, very sore shoulder, road rash knee,, cracked the helment after VERY hard bounch off the ashphalt. My head was very well protected. Old Victgoal helmet did its job VERY well. I feel very safe with their equipment."
"I'm a paramedic and thought this helmet had it all. I'm pretty critical since people's lives depend on how well my brain functions. I opened the box and put on the helmet...  almost zero padding inside! Lots of packing in the shell. The exterior is great, but the interior is seriously lacking. It fits about a size smaller, but I didn't play with the adjustment much. I decided early on I was returning the helmet for the cheaper and better rated Schwin. I can add my own rear light. I have the replacement from Schwin and love it, tons of padding and fits perfectly."
"Good fit, sturdy clipping. Its back light is a bit small but will do the job when riding in the dark. It came with a recharging USB cable, but the cable is so dang short that you don't have much flexibility when placing the helmet while it charges. The plug in was rather hard to find and there is no indicator that it's even charging. Overall, it's a bit cheaply made but will do the job."
Very comfortable and cool. Magnetic eye shields have great vision and easy to swap to the yellow or clear if you buy separately. If you ride at night you will want the clear or yellow so you can still keep the bugs out of your eyes. Fits great. Haven't crashed so I don't know how well it protects tho. USB charging for the blink light is easier than swapping batteries on the older style but not as bright to be seen in sunlight as the old style but will stand out on low light or night. I have both models. Net in top helps keep the bugs from getting through the vents. Been really happy with it
"The helmet, removable visor and magnetic goggles arrived two days after ordered as promised. Packaging was in perfect condition. I was kind of leery of the goggles because I had never tried on a helmet that had them. I was very pleasantly surprised at the unimpeded vision I had. The goggles have a very nice smokey tint and had good glare reduction as well. I also had concerns about the goggles being held on by magnets but I popped them , very easy by the way, and proceeded to shake my head like a madman. They didn't budge. Using the adjustable sizing knob I was able to get a perfect fit for my slightly larger than average head (no comments from the peanut gallery!). It is very light and comfortable. The removable/washable liner is a definite plus. The fact that the rear of the helmet extends further down than a lot of others is nice and it also adds to the protection factor. The helmet has very good ventilation which is very important to me as I live in south Florida. The only drawback, although no biggy, is with the chin strap adjuster. I had to play with it a little but got it adjusted fine. The USB rechargeable rear multi-function light is cool and makes you much more visible to traffic than just having a tail light down under your saddle. I did notice that the light was beginning to come out of the helmet when I pulled it out of the box. I had read a couple of reviews that mentioned this issue but it was very easily negated by simply wedging a couple pieces of wire tie ends I cut on the sides of the light which cannot be seen at all once the light is in place. The included storage pouch is also pretty cool. I shopped all over the web looking for a helmet in the $50 +/- range and this one was my clear winner. Highly recommended."
"My helmet arrived a little late, other than that I have no gripes about this product. This helmet is great. Very comfortable due to the nice padded liner. Fit is as close to perfect as it gets. Nice padded chinstrap. This is probably the most well ventilated cycling helmet I've ever owned. Even when pushing hard on mixed terrain on the gravel bike on a hot day it keeps my dome cool. I love that the built in safety light is USB rechargeable. A big selling point for me was the removable sun visor as I will be using it as both a road and mountain bike helmet. I also love the sun goggle as I wear prescription lenses but like to wear sunglasses when on the bike, but can't see as well as I would like when I switch from my specs to sunglasses. The goggle allows me to wear my glasses underneath so I can see clearly. I am very impressed with the quality of this helmet at this price point. In short. I love this helmet."
This is a great helmet if you have a large head. My noggin is 6.75 and this helmet is too large. I like the style and the initial fit so I cut some flexible foam and placed it in the front to keep the goggles from banging my nose. Now it doesn't slide forward and down onto my nose.
"I've only been back to cycling for two years and already had a good starter helmet which was fine on local bike paths. When I graduated to occasional road biking, I felt I needed more and this helmet is perfect. It's easily adjusted, is comfortable, has the removable visor and goggles and a rear light with 3 settings. For me, besides safety, one of my favorite features is the magnetic goggles. The magnets are stronger than I expected and I like that they are a bit further from my eyes than sunglasses. At the same time, my eyes are protected from bugs or any other minor debris. The light is higher on the rear rather than at the base making it more visible. I've already purchase 2 additional goggles in different colors and would definitely buy again."
"After never wearing a helmet when mtn biking(because I sweat too much)I saw the error of my ways and found this great helmet that is lightweight,comfy and strong. It fits my head nicely,has 2 detachable components(visor and sun shield) and even has a rechargeable LED safety light on the back. Also includes usb charger and storage bag. I only mtn bike as a hobby/exercise but so far it has held up well and my head doesn't feel sweaty and hot. It was very reasonably priced and feels strong and should protect my head if I fall off the bike. Although I would like to support my local bike shop,I just can't bring myself to pay2-3 times the price that is offered here. Overall,very happy with my purchase and feel like I am protected now from falls and bumps."
Helmet fits fine but the visor that comes with doesn't really connect to anything. It has three prongs that you're supposed to just push into the foam sides of the helmet. Some people might have had better luck but it's a poor design. Overall it was a good value.
This is a lightweight helmet and has a great red light feature on the back that comes in useful at night. I have an extra red light under my seat but this is higher and easier for the cars to see me. The visor blocks out the sun glare and then the removable dark lens is also a great feature.
"I like this helmet. It feels sturdy, well made and is especially well ventilated to avoid a hot, sweaty head and 'helmet hair' by providing a good airflow through the helmet while out on the road. I also found it lighter in weight than my previous helmet and in the low autumnal sun I found the clip-on peak to be at just the right angle when pedalling into the setting sun while, in strong headwinds the snap-on magnetic visor kept the wind out of my eyes and preventing them from streaming - which is a daily problem for me on chilly morning rides.The interior is well padded and the entire padding with insect net are removable for washing (much better than lining it with kitchen roll!). There were no parts which chaffed and I found it completely comfortable on full-day rides of +50 miles. Fit-wise it is marginally too large. Although sized at 57-62cm and having a 57cm head - it was just slightly looser than I would have liked but soon resolved by adding a few extra padding strips or, as I did initially, wearing a this skull-cap beneath it for protection from autumnal wind and rain.As for styling, I like this too. The rear has a good overhang from my head to give good protection in the event of an accident and a further excellent safety feature is the rear lamp with its 3 modes (static red, flashing red and slow-fading/flashing red) which those cycling behind me reassured me was highly visible in dusk and complete darkness. This is rechargeable via USB and on is flashing modes lasted a good 3 hours before returning home to recharge it. After using this, I would always now look for this feature on any future helmets - although I doubt I'll need to replace this for some time.I was pleased to see a CE stamp (hopefully genuine), conformance to EN1078 and a CPSC accredited testing stickers.I am very happy with this helmet which has now become my daily helmet."
Very good quality.Lightweight.This helmet fits my head perfectly.It does have a handy head adjustment at the back of the helmet so you can find tune the fit if needed.I love the built in rechargeable light.My wife surprised me with it and was so happy with the product she ordered one for herself.
"While the helmet appears to be of good quality, it has a serious design flaw. it sits very forward on the head to the point it covers the top part of my eyes. it ends up resting and putting pressure on my glasses. i have not been able to use the visor as it sits on the bridge of my nose and would cut into it if i wore it long enough. The nose cutout in the visor would need to be cut up about an inch to avoid this. i have used it numerous times and tried all the available adjustments but it does not help. My wife used it and she also had the same issues. i paid twice as much as others because i was willing to pay for a good product, but in this case, money did buy quality. i am sending it back."
"Very sturdy and comfortable, I always forget I am wearing it. The visor is great too during sunny days or when riding in the woods as it acts as a fly screen.I used it on the first day I received it and have used it every day since.I was getting back into cycling after many years so my riding skills were a bit rusty.So on my first day back into cycling I stopped and turned during a ride, as I set off again I lost my balance and I fell sideways and hit my head on a tree, the helmet did its job and all was OK.I thanked myself for being sensible enough to wear a helmet."
I really like this helmet. I like the option to wear or take off the visor and goggles. The goggles can be a little uncomfortable if you let the goggles rest on your nose. I like the goggles without sunglasses and wear them off my nose. It is also nice that it has a rechargeable light built into the helmet. I have not noticed that the helmet is warm--but I think that is a good thing.
"I just ordered a 2nd helmet after having a bad bike crash. My helmet, this same exact helmet, saved my head. I hit the pavement so hard that ribs were broken but despite my head also hitting the pavement, the helmet did its job and I had no head or neck injury. The helmet was hardly dented but for future safety I bought a new one, identical to the first. I also particularly like the visor which shields my face from wind and bugs, and the flashing light helps me feel safer from vehicles coming up from behind."
"Comfortable, and lightweight. The helmets interior strap is adjustable to fit any size head and has a an added benefit of a padded chin strap. The best surprise however was the sunglass shield, which magnetically attaches, no hard to snap on or off rivets and fits over my prescription glasses. The back light offers plenty of visibility for those of us riding in the dark and has three different lighting modes. I would recommend this helmet for anyone looking for a comfortable, functional, safe helmet that offers some additional benefits."
"Fantastically comfortable while also remaining secure. It's easy to adjust and the sizing was just right (I have a big head, so I appreciate the sizing being spot on).The integrated LED light works like a charm and I appreciate that it has a slow pulsing mode in addition to steady on and flashing modes. Being USB rechargeable is a huge boon and incredibly easy to do, although I wish it popped out of the helmet.The sunglasses visor snaps on perfectly and I'm able to use my prescription glasses without a single issue! It doesn't impact my peripheral vision anymore than normal either.The sun visor is more of a permanent snap on, but I suspect you could get it back off if you're careful enough.The best helmet I've ever worn in well over 30 years."
"Great looking helmet and with the visors looks to be really good and with the rechargeable light on the back. Only thing I found was not as snug on the smallest setting as would have liked but with the strap done up to the right setting should be ok. My head is too big for a childs helmet but a little small for adults size, this is the best one I could find to do the job as it is easily adjusted."
"Great helmet. I was afraid it would be too big due to other reviews, I have a small head. But I adjusted it and it fits great. The goggles are awesome. My only complaint is it said it was yellow. I was hoping the picture was wrong but it is more of a green color. Anyway, I would recommend it. It's very comfortable.a"
"Awesome helmet. Very stylish and the way the goggles clip on it ingenious. It just takes so long to ship. I wish they offered clear goggles too. Other than that, this is a great helmet. Very satisfied. My wife wanted one after seeing mine, so I ordered her one. Unfortunately it takes 2 months to get here."
So far I very much like this helmet - though I haven't been able to tell what makes this one ...  uperior...  in terms of keeping your head cool compared to others yet. Adjusting the straps to fit your head could use a bit more clear instructions and I'm not sure about the fitting because the sunglasses visor hits my nose a little sometimes. However overall I definitely recommend this helmet especially for frequent riders in sunny areas. The sunglass visor was a selling point for me and it was the right choice in my case.
"This helmet is a good quality, light weight helmet. I commute by bike every day so this feels like a necessity even though I did not use a helmet for the previous 65 years, it feels like the right thing to do. I really like the tinted visor as it reduces glare but more importantly keeps the cold wind off my face and reduces eye watering in bright sun."
"Amazing performance vs price!Great fit without having to fiddle with adding or adjusting pads. Rotating tightener like the expensive helmetsLight (with included charging cable) works well and is high-vis. Getting the connectors to mate was a little bit rough. Should get easier with practiceThe visor does not lock in well in the center. I'll need some time to play with it if I plan on using it (so far, I don't plan on using it)The magnetic sunglass is excellent! No issues there. My glasses fit nicely underneathSorry folks... I'm not going to give it the ultimate test... I have to trust that it was built properly and from the proper materialsFor the price, it's a winner!"
After receiving the helmet I was very happy with this product. some of the best features for this is the helmet has a very hard front is very breathable as it has ventilation holes and is very lightweight and fits snug. the material is also very solid. I also really like the detachable windshield for the eyes. the instructions on how to attach and detach is very clear. the windscreen also blocks out their sun. which works great as a shades on sunny days. the red light on the back of the helmet is also very handy it has three different settings which is great depending on where you are biking as it saves the taillights for cycling.Overall I am very happy with the product and would recommend if you're looking for a good quality light weight biking helmet for a good price.
"Overall, it's agreat helmet! I ride along highways and like the flashing light and all the reflective areas on the helmet and straps.I wear glasses so have to take the visor off each time I put the helmet on. Other than that minor convenience, it is a very good buy."
"The helmet is lightweight but strong. The removable visor and goggles are absolute pluses, such a neat feature. The straps are well made and adjust easily, and then can be wrapped to prevent unwanted slipping. It also comes with a nice little bag for when I am done riding and want to store my helmet away. I would gladly recommend this to friends and family."
"Edit to add 1/17/22:I've had this helmet for about a month and a half now, with roughly 3 weeks of use and the reflective yellow is beginning to fade from use.-----Best part is the magnetic visor. It's strong and stays attached until removed by hand. Blocks wind so I can see. when it's windy and stuff is blowing around the visor protects me eyes. The visor it comes with digs into my nose a bit. Bought a clear visor for night time rides. Love the ability to change out visors."
"It is way to adjust and not too heavy. It was packaged in a standard box with other items so I have no idea whether it had been dropped and the structure compromised before I received it which has concerned me.The magnetic lens is handy over glasses but it drops off at the first provocation. All round, it's ...  k...  but I...  l be buying another at some point soon"
"While the light on the helmet is far too dim to be observable from a distance, particularly in daytime, the fact that it can be recharged without having to pull it off the helmet and charge it and the struggle to put it back exactly where it was, is a great asset. I have another helmet that makes handling the light a major production!The detachable magnetic goggles are great, I have already ordered two different colors."
"These helmets are superb Very light,comfortable,look good tooI like the colours that are available and the option to have a visor is a big plus point in my opinionThe visor is held on with strong magnets and gives good vision The rear light that's built in is great and I love the rechargeable function fitted I have now bought another for my partner and she too says it's comfortable light etc She also noted that the visor is good if you wear glassesI did have a problem with one of my helmets BUT the customer service from Victgoal was absolutely fantastic and I can't thank them enough for their quick resolution they are truly 5* and I would recommend them to anyone"
"I'm 70 years old. I decided to buy an ebike and ride it in the desert. About 2 miles in, on my 2nd ride, I hit some sand and it threw me off my bike. Even though I had some bad injuries, the injuries would have been so much worse without the helmet. Pulled 2 rocks out that were embedded. They would have been in my head. Very good helmet. Gave the bike and helmet to my son. LOL"
This bike helmet is extremely comfortable and safe. It comes with a simple to adjust harness that you set once and and then use the safety clip 2 to hold it under your chin. There's an LED light at the back which is extremely bright but do not blind other drivers. The visor is extremely useful if like me you use your bike in the mud so you don't get it in your eyes. This visor is easily detached for any other kind of rides. It provides very good ventilation so you do not sweat too much on your head. The design is very stylish with the black and white stripes and matches many jackets available-for-sale.
"I've not had a bicycle in 40 years, so after purchasing a mountain bike I thought I'd get the helmet too. Love the magnetic goggles on this and can even wear it while wearing my glasses. Easily adjustable and not so different from my equestrian helmet. I love the bag that came with it and use it for storage from the handlebar when not riding my bike. Lightweight, rechargeable light, and looks better with the removable visor vs. without it."
"Great helmet easily adjusts to your required fit .The built in light is very bright and has 3 modes on, fast flash ,slow flash.Easily charged by usb and the perplex Google's are great if like me you wear glasses I did by a clear set to for night time or rainy days .Overall carry happy with this purchase and it was well package and comes with its on storage bag"
"I have a large head , and the helmet just fits when adjusted fully open. The problem is my sunglasses won't fit under the face shield. So I purchased some small round magnets, and use them as spacers to push the face mask out. Now my smallest glasses will fit under the mask. But my big sunglasses still wont fit. Helmet feels heavy compared to my other name brand one. Lite only lasts a few rides(20 miles or so) then it needs to be charged. I do like keeping the sun off my face. The bright yellow is easy to see from a distance. I wish the manufacturer would make a large version of this."
"Great style, Lightweight, was able to adjust just to headsize with a turn if the knob.Plastic goggles bounced around while on my ride and kept hitting my nose, hence 3 stars for stability...maybe stronger magnets? How can I fix this? Shield keeps wind out of my eyes.Also, arrived with a dent on top.4 stars...5 would be no dent and better magnets to secure to unit better."
I really like the face shield. I use this riding my electric bike and I've had alot of bugs bounce off the facehshield that would have otherwise pegged my face. I like the integrated led light in the back. My only complaint is that the ratchet sizing system doesn't go small enough and the helmet fits a bit loose. I'm needing to rig it with something to make a more snug fit.
"I bought this helmet because I want to be more visible to traffic. The design is very nice looking, the colors options are cool. Straps are very comfortable. light charge with USB port. Comes with a very flexible visor and shield with magnets for easy removal. Check my channel in YouTube LetsRollQ for unboxing and review of this helmet."
"Comfortable and stylish, fits me well. The led on the back is a plus, although when in riding position this is pointed more at the sky than behind you. This helmet looks and feels like it would provide reasonable protection in a crash.I like the idea of the visor, but the gray tint is pretty dark and I wouldn't use it except in direct sunlight. I bought the yellow tinted one separately, which works on cloudy days and even at night. The notch for your nose on both visors was too small for me and I had to use a hobby knife to keep them from riding on my nose. No matter which of my three pairs of glasses I wear, the inside of the visor presses against them lightly, kind of annoying, but not so bad as to make the visor unusable. The assist on my ebike cuts out at 28 mph, so I generally move along pretty quick when I am riding, and the visors really help cut down on eye watering and keep bugs off of the upper half of my face. I just wish the visor setup was designed better, so that it wouldn't press against my nose and glasses."
"Likes: neatly made; many large vents; removable bug net; suitable for mountain biking or commuting; extends quite low at the back, snug fit, good adjustment, has reflective material on the straps, removable padded chin strap for comfort, easy to adjust and release under-chin buckle, well finished and moulded exterior, robust feel. Rear light is a nice touch and reassuring back up to bike lights. USB rechargeable light comes with usb cable. Manual included for fitting and maintaining, also has a carry bag. Removable goggles are a nice touch and sit far enough away from the face to allow wearing prescription glasses.Dislikes: slightly heavy for wearing all day, goggles rattle a little when off road, strap adjuster under ears moves when taking off and on."
"Their fit guide is very misleading. I guess they just measured the circumference of the helmet and posted it. The problem is that people's heads come in different shapes. Unless your head has the exact shape as the helmet, it may not fit into the helmet even if its circumference falls right in the middle of the claimed range. They did post the width of the helmet to be 7 in / 18 cm, which could have solved the problem. However, if you don't want your head to be squeezed, that width should be 6.3 in / 16 cm, much smaller than the 7 in / 18 cm as they claimed.I give 2 stars instead of 1 because the design with the magnetic goggle is cool. My daughter ends up taking it so I don't need to return it."
This is a very comfortable helmet. The shield protects the eyes from the wind and the rear light is a safety aid.The review asks about warmth. In summer one does not want a warm helmet - and this helmet has good ventilation; my head has not gotten hot. It has always been comfortable.
"I like the comfort. I ride to work early in the morning so the light on the back of the helmet is good for visibility for drivers coming up behind me. Also, I don't have to worry about safety eyewear since the visor is included and the magnets do a great job holding it in place."
"The helmet's hardness is great and the light works exceptionally well. The challenge is the straps. They loosen over time easily and cause the helmet to slip too easily. I'm geri-rigging a fix so that it stays put, and we'll see how it goes. The challenge is that the straps don't have any stickiness to create friction having it stay put. Otherwise it's a useful helmet."
Great helmet at great price. Goggles did push on my nose but were easily adjusted out with magnets. I put one on each side and two in the center. The helmet's goggles work better than ski goggles because they are vented better. I had dual layer ski goggles that still fogged in low temperatures especially near dew point. I put anti fog on the helmet goggles and was able to ride at 3F and still see. I mounted the rear view mirror on the outside rather than inside of the helmet to not interfere with the goggles. I bought the clear goggles to be able to ride to work in the winter in Wisconsin.
"I accidentally got a large, but when my husband saw the helmet he immediately wanted it. So I bought a small one for myself. It blocks the wind really well so now I don't tear up in the wind. The visor pops on and off very easily, so I think you would be able to ride with glasses on underneath pretty easily. So glad I found this because my eyes are very sensitive to wind."
"After 3 months and 1500 miles, I am still pleased with this helmet. The tinted googles keep your eyes from watering in head winds. The gray googles may interfere with some polarized eyeglasses but overall they are very good for reducing glare. By not using the included black visor you can conveniently store the goggles reversed in the ""up"" position for when you don't need them. When buying extra goggles (yellow, clear, etc.) note that VG sells two styles which are not interchangeable. The rechargeable rear light changes from red to green when fully charged. The helmet straps tend to loosen over time but tacking them in place with a stitch or two with thread fixes the problem easily. Not as stylish as the big $$ versions, this helmet is still a great value."
"I decided to buy it because the description mentioned that it would fit to a round measurement of 24 inches, which is me. Unfortunately my head overall fits, but it feels tight on the sides. I am sure that it will be uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes.I returned it today."
"Really pleased with this excellent helmet. The shape and design is really good looking and the features such as the rechargeable backlight and the magnetic visor are really cool.One slight issue I had is that, with my odd shaped long head, there's a plastic bit on the inside at the back that is a little bit scatchy. However, a bit of insulating tape on it has sorted the issue out and it's really comfy.The chin strap is easy to adjust and comfy. The visor is excellent and nice and easy to quickly pull it off if not needed or if things start to steam up and then clip it back on whilst in motion.Really delighted with this helmet!"
"It fits better than my other helmits. Like the magnetic goggles too. Had retina surgery and it really helps cut down the wind and sun while riding. The visor portion is a little longer, which is what I was looking for. Only question or issue is where can I get another goggle piece if needed?"
05/31/2022I like it have used it about 2 years and still perfect I LOVED (PAST TENTS) the visor but it scratched up quick like in the first 2 months loved the magnet hold just slap it on and rip it off no fuss. Might last longer for you cause I'm pretty hard on my belongings the light in back is cool but very. Very dim. I hardly used it . Now the helmet itself that's what I'm talking about love to this day but I think it's about time to upgrade so I'm off to see what upgrades this seller has because there shipping packaging and product are up to par for the price you can't go wrong.That's my opinion and no one gave me a free sample or other free-bees for my opinion
"There are a couple similar helmets out there, I chose this one even tho it is a bit pricier. It is lightweight (310g claimed), certified (claimed) and comes in good packaging. I have round head 58 cm and it fits ok. Light is integrated and has USB charging cable. The Visor has just the right amount of cut, my nose is not touching it and I can fit a decent sized square glasses under it. Many vent holes.Since I have not crashed with it (knock wood) so cannot really tell how it performs. But everything else looks very good."
"My husband and I recently bought some Ebikes so we needed bike helmets and saw these and like the fact that they had the magnetic goggles. We are really happy with the helmets, they fit good and we really like that the magnetic goggles come off quickly and can be attached to the helmet even if we aren't using them. The goggles also make things so convenient because you don't have to remember to grab your sunglasses! We have even recommended the helmets to our neighbors."
"I needed a new helmet and liked the idea of getting one with 1-a built in rear blinker, and 2-a visor. I LOVE having the visor because it keeps the knats from getting in my eyes. They used to get around my sun glasses and get stuck in my eye. I had to stop, take off my helmet and gloves, and flush the bug out with water from my water bottle (probably not the best thing to use with backwash, but better than sticking my fingers in my eyes). I have had the helmet for about 3 weeks now and here it is in the height of bug season, and no more knats in my eyes. I think the visor actually creates a wind current around my face that pretty much deflects the bugs away because I have had fewer bugs in my mouth and nose as well. I ride 165 miles a week and probably at least half of that is through an area that is along a river (so lots more bugs!). The visor does scratch VERY easily though, so when you pop it off you have to be very careful not to drop it.The battery recharges really quickly (2 hours or less) and lasts for at least 2 rides (I alternate 30 miles/2.5 hrs one day and 25 miles/2 hrs the next) with enough juice to last if I end up getting sidetracked. I haven't tried seeing if it would last 3 days but I think it would last at least part way through the third.The helmet is comfortable and adjusted easily. The plastic coating does seem a little thinner than my old Bell helmet, but isn't it the foam that really absorbs the impact? It seems to come down a little farther on the back of my head because I have to secure my pony tail lower down than with my last helmet --- a good thing. I wish I had this 2 months ago when I wrecked and got thrown into a gate made of 2"" diameter pipe that hit just below the edge of my helmet. Might have spared myself that 2 day headache."
"4.5 STARS !! VERY VISIBLE, USB LIGHT IS GOOD!I had to glue the liner down as it irritated my forehead.I had no need for the visor and it would fall off if you touched it. UN-necessary marketing gimmick.I would buy it again, and would have giving it 5 stars if they fine tuned there quality control ."
"My grandkids thought I had the coolest helmet of all when 15 of us biked the 17 mile Hiawatha Trail in Northern Idaho last month. I loved the magnetic attached visor! The air would flow under it unlike sunglasses which went along wonderfully with the lightweight, easy flow helmet! Wonderful trip!!!"
"A nice surprise! Looks good, fits an average size head real well! Light on the head and even has sunglasses you can attach and put over your glasses! Very satisfied & happy with my birthday gift. It even goes well with my all black Priority Commuter bike."
"Overall, this is a great helmet, quality build and finish. The light works great and came with a USB cord.The goggle visor is very clear and the magnet attachment are very strong. The only down side is the goggle vision come down to far around the nose (hitting the bridge of the nose). Tried to adjust the helmet straps to pull the helmet back on his head. It would be best to trim the goggle back around the nose area.Also the helmet came with a bag to store your helmet. I would buy again."
These helmets are AMAZING!! I love the fit and how incredibly comfortable these helmets really are. The detachable goggles are really nice and I don't think I will have any issues while on a bike ride. The upgraded rechargeable light on the back of the helmet is nice and bright and will come in handy because of added safety.We purchased the blue helmet and the red helmet and the colors are just beautiful!! The colors are very vibrant and are put together very well! I love the chin support/cushion which adds a nice feature to the helmet and adds to the comfort of the helmets.Customer service for this company is top notch!!! They are very responsive and will take care of any issues that might come up. I would definitely purchase from this company again!
"This is a great helmet. It is comfortable and fit is great. It is not the most lightweight helmet but it is definitely my favorite. I have several helmets, some popular brands and some inexpensive china models. This one is the best among all of them. This one feels more substantial, and the visor and the goggles are cool. When I first got this I did not put the visor on and I used it for my road bike. It looks good and I wore it for several hundred miles. Then I bought a new helmet to use for my road bike (a more expensive helmet from a popular brand) and I gotta say that this helmet is nicer. However since I have that other helmet for my road bike, I put the visor on this one and now use it for my Mountain bike. It looks great and is still my favorite of all the helmets I have. I am going to leave the visor on (not sure if it will come off very easy) I will probably buy another one of these. You cannot go wrong with this helmet. I do not use the light on the back or the goggles but they do work well."
"It is great that the light is rechargeable and doesn't take CR2032.I'll never use the visor.It is slightly too wide for its length, so doesn't fit my head perfectly. Unlike another helmet I have, you can tighten it and it does then fit, but there remains a big gap between the band and the outer shell."
"Got this helmet as a father's day present earlier this year. I was very pleased with the quality of it and the fit/adjustability was excellent too. I did wonder about the visor, but I'm finding I prefer them to sunglasses as it guarantees full visibility and still protects my eyes at speed.Then a couple of days ago I was going downhill on gravel, perhaps faster than I should and I took big tumble. I know the helmet took a big impact, and I do now need a new one, but it held together and most importantly I wasn't knocked out and my head is still in one piece. Once the rest of my body has recovered, I'll definitely buy another one of these to replace it!"
Love the removable visor. Can see either when it's dark or light out. It blocks out the sun very well. It's very lightweight yet sturdy and strong. Love the light in the back of the helmet that you can turn and keep it lit or you can adjust the light to be a fade in/out or even make it blink.
I found this helmet to be so comfortable that I forget that I have it on at times. The breathability is great; it keeps my head cool and sweat free. The removable goggles are a huge plus. They not only give me a wide unobstructed view but also do an awesome job of blocking out the wind. I took them off on a windy day and my eyes suddenly felt irritated even though I wear a pair of large glasses. The only thing I wish they could add is a way to fasten eyeglass straps to the goggles so that I won't have to worry about scratching it or accidentally leaving it behind when I take it off and place them on a table.
"I love the features of the helmet. LED gives added piece of mind when riding on the road early mornings. Strap is very easy to adjust and I'm impressed that it even has a soft cover that keeps your chin from getting chafed. I ride in cold weather a lot so the visor was key to combat fogging issues, and the helmet fits well (with adjustment) over my balaclava."
"Well I am biased. This is the replacement for the one I was wearing when I went over the handlebars. Elbows and knees not so good, but my head is intact, thanks. The face shield was scoured by the asphalt--but not my face! This is what counts. I like the way the helmet wraps the back of the head more than the ""cap"" type helmets. By the way, I have ordered the replacement clear face shield (goggles) and it fits perfectly. Bruised thumbs up!"
The one thing I can't stand is cycling without my sunglasses on!! Not only does it stop the sun shining in my eyes but it also stops me being blinded by bugs! ... Only problem is my glasses! Problem solved a magnetic visor that literally pops on and covers the whole eye area!! Boom!
"This is a very comfortable helmet with easy adjusents for chin and fit around the head. It just slides on and always feels secure.Back light in the helmet is a neat idea but I have continuosly forgotten to charge it, getting the helmet to a charger is not always convenient. The on off button for the light has no tactile feedback so you've no idea whether you managed to turn it on. Or off.The visor was the main reason I bought this but it fogs up almost immediately of you go indoors. You can remove the visor bit the very first thing I did was lose it. I bought the clear plastic variation too, both fog with a face mask. You can rock the helmet back on your head a little but you will still struggle to see indoors if wearing a mask that covers your nose.I love this helmet for the comfort and would recommend on that basis. If the plastic visor was attached and could be slid back it would be viable with some separately purchased anti fog spray."
"After looking at the junk for sale in some of the big stores near me i knew that i wanted something with a lot more quality. what is the old biker saying ""how much is your head worth""? Sure you can spend a couple of hundred dollars i suppose but what for. this has very good protection, excellent visor, comfortable chin strap, great rear helmet light, and even a tinted lens as well. i live in Florida and knew i needed something cool. this is very cool. when i come to the end of my ride i sometimes forget that i have it on. feel silly almost going into a store wearing it, and almost have a time or two. this is a very reasonable price for a helmet of this quality. i have already recommended it to my friends. Get it, you will be glad you did."
"Used the helmet for the first time this morning. Reasonably comfortable and the visor fits over prescription glasses really nicely and offers good protection from sun, wind and insects. Not sure how effective the USB light is but a good addition the cycle's rear light."
"Helmet is very comfortable, and I really like the visor. I ordered a second clear visor when it became available. It adjusts very well, and the chin strap is as comfortable as one can be. Color is bright, but already fading after 2 months of use (100 miles per week), enough that I believe it will be nearly white by one year (similar to other safety yellow helmets I've owned).BIG PROBLEM - the light charges well still in the helmet, but can be removed if needed. It always felt like it was snapped in tight, but after 3 months it fell out somewhere along the road, and I have been unable to find it again. Now I have a gaping hole in the back of my helmet that no other light will fit. I have not seen where it can be purchased separately."
"I have attached rear lights to my bike helmets for years. I was ready for a new helmet, and thought that the long-lasting built-in light with this helmet would be wonderful. As with most bikers, 99% of my miles are in daylight Unfortunately, the light is so dim during the day that there is virtually no chance of gaining the driver's attention beyond 100 yards.....which is not enough for safety. Otherwise, the helmet has good fit and adjustability. I purchased it in bright yellow, which is otherwise good for visibility. I have purchased a CygoLite 200 Lumen light to attach, which has turned this into a $75 helmet/light combo. Just too bad the Victgoal does not contain a viable rear light....even a 25 lumen blinkie would change my rating to 5-stars."
"This is a great helmet which comes well accessorized. In the box is:HelmetDetachable one-piece gogglesDetachable sun visorUSB charging cableCarry bagPaperworkThe helmet itself is very cool in it's on-trend matt black finish with white flashes and even hi-viz detailing on the straps. Being a bit of a visibility nerd though I...  l probably further snazz it up with some high viz tape. Talking of which, I absolutely love the rear light. It's built in so no chance of losing it and it has three modes in use. Comfort is great with it being light and sturdy but also fully adjustable and there is also some padding on the chin strap which is most welcome. The manufacturers have obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this item.The sun visor completes the MTB look (if desired) but the one-piece magnetic goggle is a fabulous feature giving you further eye protection and the full-on TT/Robocop profile with great eye protection at just the right distance from your face. It is a doddle to put on and pull off one-handed though I am a little concerned it may come off when going over big bumps. Not happened yet though and so far I am very impressed with this item that also represents excellent value for money."
"I have been really impressed with this helmet, and the attachable visor feature is superbWhen in use, the helmet is comfortable and lightweight and very easy to adjust. The small peak at the front is makes it more like a ""mountain bike"" helmet for than a standard ""rounded street bike"" helmet and adds a bit of character to the helmet itself. There are decent vents of the top to generate a cool ""airy"" feeling when worn and the black effect is very stylish. However the real gem on this helmet is the attachable front visor which acts like sunglasses and is superb to wear on bright sunny days. The visor itself offers decent protection against the sunlight but they are not polarized like some others on the market, however they do offer UV protection.Overall this is a great helmet in terms of comfort, style and functionality with the visor option and at this price offers superb value for money too - I would certainly recommended!"
"I liked the advertised features, the design, the sturdiness, and the price. Supply-line delays were expected to be more than eight weeks until delivery. To my delight the product was delivered two months early!I am very pleased with this bike helmet. One size DOES fit all! It is comfortable and very adjustable for safe fitting head protection. Its unique, magnetically attached, tinted eye piece is an attention getter and functions well for both physical and optical eye protection. Yes, and it is stylish, too."
"I was not sure if this helmet would be good but after trying it out with the new bike (in the dark) I really do love it. It is way more comfortable then I thought, regardless of it being hard like other helmets. It just fit my head way better. The straps are strong and can be adjusted easily to keep it nice and tight.I have not set up a front headlight on it but I may later on. There is a red light on the back of it that can be recharged and I was told it is really easy to see me in the dark."
"Comfortable, red light on the rear, magnetic detachable tinted visor. All you need in a helmet.The detachable visor is a great touch as unlike with sunglasses you don't see the frame when in the top half of your vision (where you look up at the road ahead and to the side etc) your whole cycling vision is tinted.Used for about a month so far, only 20min riding per day and i haven't recharged the helmet light yet."
I really like this helmet a lot with all the extra red light features on the back of the helmet. The helmet is really lightweight but once you put it on and tighten it up it fits my head pretty good and I have a small head. I can never find baseball caps in my size but this helmet came in my size and I really enjoyed it a lot that I bought another one with different colors to give to my bicycle buddy. My favorite part about this helmet is the magnetic shades. I was going to buy bicycle glasses but now that it comes with the magnetic visor I don't need goggles or glasses the shield on the helmet works great.
"Good helmet, very comfortable with the inner net cushion, I have a big head and it fits fine and feels good.The helmet looks good and feels quite solid and lightweight. The sun visor clips on and I think makes it look better so I leave it on all the time, it can pop of again with a tug if you want to.The eye protection is very good, it attaches by magnets that look like press studs and they are strong enough to hold it in place with the vibrations and if I knock it when moving the helmet on my head. They come down and cover you peripheral vision as well so you don't get wind in your eyes, they work better than sunglasses.The red light at the back is a good touch and adds some safety and it's easily recharged with the usb lead. You also get a carry bag and a snood as well.Not the cheapest helmet but it's made well and I'm pleased with it."
Unfortunately when i came to put it together the peak clips into three holes but the front one is impossible to click in so the peak can move up and down and is not secure.For the price i would of expected better.
"The helmet is well made, lightweight and comfortable to wear.The integrated USB rechargeable light and the magnetic visor are great value-added components.Very stylish and, in my opinion, well worth the money."
"Outstanding helmet and very light to wear and comfortable, easy to adjust and rear light is a great feature. Air flow feature keeps your head cool all the time. Highly recommend"
"I love everything about this helmet except the strap kept coming off. I fixed the problem easy enough with a flame to melt the nylon together, not everyone will have the inclination."
"Sporty look , solid construction and eye shield easily fits over glasses, magnets hold well on eye shield , adjustable straps and chin buckle provide comfortable secure fit. Arrived a week early packed well undamaged."
"Helmet looks waay better in the pictures to be fair. The front piece if badly mounded and keeps popping off unless you decide to use super-glue on it, but then its there for good. it does the job, just would have liked it to work as in the video"
"My first helmet purchase and I nailed it. The visor is great for cold trips or wind. Easy magnet pop on visor. Comfort is great, convenient light. Light is good for night but not bright enough for day. Comes with a it own storage bag."
"It does the job but the helmet is too large for my head (I have a regular-sized head), even selecting the smallest size. I have to remove it from my eyes all the time."
"Really pleased with the helmet. Love the visor, keeps insects away.Only con, I wish a clear visor had also been included with the package. I have recommended this to a couple of my cycling friends."
Great helmet for modern day use. Tried in rain and better than putting sunglass. No fog to worry about. Rechargeable light is fantastic modern concept to be seen while on road.
"Love the helmet, but the strapping on the neck is uncomfortable. I think a chine strap would be better. Do you know if an alternate chin strap is available."
I wanted a helmet with goggles this one is very comfortable. I have a few different helmets and I find myself grabbing this one all the time. It came with a missing chin pad and i contacted the seller and they sent one to me. Very nice helmet.
"I really like how easy it is to snap on and take off the visor. You can flip the visor upside down if you are mid-ride. I like having the light on the helmet, too."
"I love this helmet especially the sun visor thing. I wear prescription glasses I don't wear sunglasses really, so I really like having that darkened visor on, it works great. And the way it magnetically connects is awesome."
"This is a great helmet. Comfortable, lightweight and fits perfectly. It's adjustable for those who have a large noggin like myself. Would highly recommend great helmet! Buy it you won't be disappointed"
"The helmet fits and works fine. Most importantly, the goggles work well without slippage and cover my upper face well with good ventilation in high temps throughout. I would buy this again."
"I like to wait a bit before writing a review to see how the product works. Fits great, breathes well, easy to adjust. The shade shield could hold a little tighter but is great. I would recommend getting one"
The size of the helmet doesn't fit everyone we got for our son and doesn't fit his head and we cannot find how to buy a bigger size or a smaller one he have the M/l
The Sun visor is amazing and fits nicely on top of my glasses without any interference. It also helps to screen insects pollens and all types of debris floating in the air. Helmet is lightweight and built-in light is very bold from afar.
The shade visor and the red rear light are great features that most helmets do not have. The fit is adjustable and feels snug and comfortable when tuned in. Highly recommended.
"Weighs next to nothing, very breathable too. Love the magnetic clip on visors.I've a 63cm head so got the largest size and its a great fit, theres actually room to spare."
Tremendous piece of kit all round. Plenty of adjustment but fits like a glove anyway. Excellent idea having the removable and changeable magnetic goggles and visor. Upgraded helmet light a great improvement. All in all 10/10 and 5 stars. BRILLIANT!!
"I love this helmet, I waited for review but it fits me perfectly every time I put it on plus I get an extra safety a night with the light at the back of the head as well as a sun shield which makes riding easier for me especially with glasses."
I love the lightweight. I'm bald though and it had some pointy ends that are not covered with padding. All it takes is one little spot to be poking you in the head to make you want to tear it off.
Visor is hazy and blurry. The helmet is light but the strap is very uncomfortable. The chin guard sits to the side of your ear because they made the straps equal length. The visor sits low on my nose and impedes vision. I returned it.
"I have a smaller head and I needed a size smaller but they only offer one size. So I had to return it. Otherwise, I liked the feel and design of the helmet."
I like the clip on sun screen. It's magnetic but holds quite well. I also like the regular visor. Very easy to interchange. The helmet itself is quite comfortable.
"This helmet looks great, has lots of features, is fully adjustable to make it very comfortable, and comes at a a great price! Shipping was also very fast. Great purchase!"
"Note for 'bent riders only: The magnetic visor doesn't cover your vision as well when you're leaning back a bit as we do. Upright cyclists: Not a problem at all, visor should work a lot like googles only not as hot."
Snug fit and breathers when I'm hot.I was knocked off my bike and landed on head looking at the bruising imprint of the helmet on my righthand upper lobe it in my mind and my wife's utterly saved my life
I had to return the helmet because it was too big in spite of adjustments. The helmet really was nice but I have a very small head and it was just too loose.
"This is the best helmet I brought since riding bikes and the light in the back is really Kool, now people can see my headlight and I want to say thank you for designing this helmet for I am satisfied. Gooday!!!"
"Helmet fit good, magnetic goggle a nice feature. Problem is that the light in rear is not very translucent-not visible in sunlight. This is needed to make you visible to cars approaching in rear.Works well for cloudy, evening use"
"Well designed, comfortable helmet. Haven't used the visor yet because the only one supplied is dark no good in winter conditions. Supplying a clear visor as well would make this a better package."
"Rear light still works and is easy to charge. Visor magnets stronger than previous similar models I've had. Visor is deep enough to keep mud off, but too dark to wear in low light. Would be good to have an alternative / 2nd visor for evening use."
"Love this lightweight bike helmet with the extra safety features such as the light in back & removable sunglasses. The ventilation is great as well. It is the first bike helmet I've owned, but I couldn't be happier with it."
The sun shade and goggles are great for my eyes because I just had surgery and need the protection from the UV rays. The light on the back of the helmet is great for added visibility in fog or low-light to prevent other drivers from hitting me.
"Great helmet, fits really well, very light, and the visor is fantastic, you forget you have it on yet it stops the direct sun-glare, really good design overall."
"I absolutely love this Helmet... from the Comfort and Breathability, The very cool and Functional Goggles that have kept so much Sun and Bugs out of my eyes and The very Visible rechargeable light embedded in the design."
"I like the visor very much, Just got an extra one for the night (yellow visor) The helmet comes with the dark visor perfect for sunny days, I'm using my medicated glasses with no trouble at all. The back does it job."
I really like this helmet. It feels great and I like the look. This works for me.. I am very pleased with this purchase. The seller was fast and very efficient in the delivery. totally happy with every thing.
"Bicycle helmets always looked wonky (opinion). This one has a sleek look and fits very well. Has a solid or blinking light that is easy to recharge. I bought electric bike (awaiting for arrival), but this helmet is bad a$$."
"Very comfortable, well made. I don't like to buy before I try, but I did anyway and I don't regret buying this helmet! Actually, I purchased one for my wife also and she likes hers also, they look nice and we're reasonable priced! Happy customer!"
Ouch ouch ouch. Not for round head shapes. Likely better for oval shapes. Fit and finish isn't great. There are better helmets for the money out there.
I like the look the style and the comfort of this helmet it has plenty of ventilation and the built-in light is very convenient and also highly safe I don't do much night Rides but when I do I'm seen! Love the detachable goggles and also the visor
"Great , light weight , but the red buckle and strap are junk , kept falling off , finally got mad and glued it so it won't fall off . I noticed most brands have this same clasp . The helmet dies fit good , nice red light in back ."
I ride 100-150 miles a week and just love this helmet. The integrated light works great and is bright. And the visor is a huge improvement over the sunglasses I used to wear. This is a great buy.
"everything is designed better. 3 way adjust for head strapping, mesh, air flow, on helmet light is bright and configurable. sun glass and visor great fit, design."
"I like everything about this helmet. Quality material, adjustable fit, great design and eye shield provides enough room to wear glasses behind it.Also, company personnel are fast to respond to any questions."
I love this helmet. The fact that it comes with a tinted visor to protect your eyes is a great feature. It attaches via magnets so it's easy to put on as well as remove.
"The helmet is great. My problem is that it was supposed to come with detachable sun shade, and that item was not in the box. If it was included, as advertised, I would have given the helmet 5 stars. But, I hate paying for something I did not get."
"Visor clips on easily, sun shade bit magnets on instantly if required, easy to adjust size and its very comfortable to wear and light is easy to operate"
The strap is easy to adjust. The inner mesh is washable and comfortable. I've owned a couple of helmets over the years and this one has great airflow and accommodates my giant head.The led light is a bonus.
"Good for the price. The visor is low quality plastic. The center piece holding it broke day 1 and its just hanging with the side ones and I wouldn't be surprised if it flies off one day while riding. Other than that, its an ok helmet"
"My head is the size of a child's and could never find an adult helmet to fit but I loved this one. I love the lights and to make it fit my head I wear a Beenie underneath. A bit warm, but safety first!"
This bike helmet is amazing. It breathes really well so your head doesn't get as hot. I love the face shield. I plan on ordering one of the yellow shields for night/dark rides.
"This is my 2nd Victgoal helmet. They fit great; the inside pads are easy to remove and clean. Easy to adjust the straps. They add protection as it is designed to, yet comfortable. The color scheme matches my bike colors."
"The helmet fits great, looks great, and will save your brain. If you use the detachable faceshield with a balaclava like I do, make sure you treat it with some anti-fog stuff."
"Great idea / concept but for me I need to wear glasses underneath the magnetic visor and that was impossible for me anyway, also didn't find the helmet very comfortable compared to another make of helmet I have, shame it kinda looks cool."
first i thought it's look like Aeroplane helmet but i found this is very usefull it's protect my eyes from wind and very comfortable to wear .just love it thought it's costly..
I was concerned it would not fit. I adjusted perfectly. The silver and blue are great. This is my first bike helmet ever.can not wait to use is when I get my new ebike in a couple of weeks.
"good designed helmet and lightweight , just fits my head which measures 60cm , the magnetic visor fits securely does not detach going over bumps have not used the rear light so cant comment on , handy bag for cycling and carrying helmet"
I was going to return it because it wouldn't fit my head. My head is small so I have to adjust it a couple of times on the straps. The removable sunglasses feature is very helpful. thumb up!  The light on the helmet is pretty helpful too.
"Absoutely essential foriding in the city. Visibility is critical. Good charge time on the light, abot 4 continous hours from what I can calculate. A very small nose is necessary in order to use the eye shield., without rubbing against it."
"Helmet is a comfortable fit, visor is a handy extra, that can be left off if not required, decent light on the back, overall I'm satisfied with the purchase"
"The helmet is comfortable and I've received compliments on in whole riding with my local race team, the visor is a bit dark tho so I...   recommend buying a clear one if your riding at night or low light conditions"
"It fits perfectly, very well made and comfortable. Visor and magnetic sun shades really makes the Victgoal Bike helmet looks very professional and expensive."
I am really happy with this helmet. It is light weight. Magnetic goggles are very good. I usually go on long bike rides. At times I forget I am wearing these goggles since they are so comfortable.
This is the most comfortable cycle helmet i have ever bought. The tinted eye screen is amazing and i never thought id use it. I wear glasses and this cover fits over them with space.It is quality gear that suits my needs.
I have bought two of these now - one for me and one for my 23 yr old daughter. I have brown and she has fluorescent green/yellow - both are super comfortable. Hers has the improved back light which is fantastic. Highly recommend!
"I love the way it looks and feels, easy to tighten and expand. The extra sun clip has magnets and makes it easy to put on and take off. Definitely recommend it."
"It is comfortable, has a sun visor which is vital in a bike helmet, and has a magnetic eye shield which keeps wind from tearing up my eyes. Very nice!"
"Seems a nice helmet, love the visor and the fact it comes with a bag, the light on the back could always be brighter for daylight use but it's not bad"
I am so happy with this helmet! It is so light and I love the design! It looks so cool and the features exceeded my expectations! Very comfortable for everyday use! I love the chin strap too! Thanks Victgoal!
Great quality product really protects your head comfortable to wear easy to adjust the vizier is excellent it keeps the cold out of your eyes and keeps the sun rays from dazzling you good value for money
"Really like it, cool shape and style.Best feature is the magnet visor.Led light on the back is a nice feature.Very adjustable and comfortable.Feels strong and safe, although I'm not keen on testing this out on a car."
"Great Helmet.Its fits perfect, very comfortable, looks sleek, and the visor is a great addition.The Flashing light on the back of the helmet is very cool.Love it!"
"The Sunshield Is Very Uncomfortable, cuys into the bridge of nose.I wore it for one season, the chin strap does not get snug enough, the padding by the forehead deterirated.Of most concern is the sun shield cutting into my nose."
The light dont charge i received a replacement and that doesn't charge either very disappointed with the item charged for hours and nothing i would like a refund for the faulty light but il keep the helmet
"This helmet provides comfortable and lightweight full head coverage. The added feature of an easy reachable rear light is a plus. For people who appreciate proactive safety and have something to protect, this helmet is a nice , reasonable choice."
Husband and I have very much enjoyed the helmets. They have been comfortable and I like the red light in the back. Husband has used the clip on shield and says it's easy and nice to use. We would buy these helmets again.
This item is all that I asked for. Really comfortable and very lightweight and the visor is brilliant. The light on the back is also really good. Highly recommended
"This helmet looks good and the fit is easily adjustable, even while riding. The rechargeable safety light works well and is easy to use and recharge. And at this price it is quite a value."
"The rear light is more visible to drivers since it's up on my head, not under my seat. The batteries last a long time and are rechargeable. The goggles are more effective than sunglasses and I can wear my regular glasses under them."
"Excellent budget helmet. I was in the Trek shop the other day and picked up one of their $200 helmets too see if it was substantially lighter, it was not. For my purposes this helmet is perfect. I've been using it daily for a couple of weeks now."
"It's what I was hoping it would be. Has a visor, a face shield or can wear it free of either. Plus the light on the back makes you feel a little bit safer! Plenty of options."
"Good rear blinking light?Check!Cool, super strong magnet, magnetically attached sunglasses visor?Check!Prevents a concrete-to-forehead concussion and road-rash that would sand off your ear?Check!Seriously, it's a good helmet. It's worth it."
"Great helmet for riding with awesome ventilation, durability, and style. It's perfect for night riding because of the light on back. 10/10 Helmet for the price!"
Nice helmet. Has slots for airflow. Like the snap on magnet feature for eye protection. Really like the red light on back of helmet. Size is adjustable with brackets.
"This helmet has a dial that allows you to get a custom fit, very cool. It also has a light on the back that has 3 settings (constant light or 2 flashing modes) Lightweight, too."
"love this helmet, very comfortable. love the magnetic removable visors and the flashing red light in back of the helmet. maybe in the future they could add a flashing light to the front also otherwise worth the investment if you ride a lot."
I smacked my head doing 25 on a sidewalk Against a low hanging branch punctured my helmet but it protected my head money well spent
Use the helmet everyday great features with light an the back of the helmet and the detachable sun glasses.
Best helmet for the money ...very light well made and comes with all the accessories u need ..thumbs up for this product
"The fit adjustment works great, and the helmets are comfortable. The visor fits over our glasses, and the light on the back charges quickly."
"Just as advertised. Easy to assemble. Visor works like a charm. Fairly snug fit on my head, but certainly shouldn't fly off."
It is very comfortable and easy to adjust the size to your head size. The light in the back helps a lot and is very useful.
I gave the comfort 4 stars because the fit is different with the lense in place. It takes some time to adjust for it.
It amazes me the built quality that the Belmont has for the price I paid. Would definitely recommend!
Excellent cycling helmet five stars for style and comfort definitely the best cycle helmet I've own over the years.
I don't really know what else to say now.....it does a great job of keeping my skull round and dentless.
Love the lid but i still havent figured out to get the chin pad UNDER my chin . Light battety has been going for 4 two hour runs. Good battery life.
I bought this for my MTB but found it a did not give enough protection. I went full face. It is fine for road bikes.
Nice fitting helmet. It does not sit high on your head like some helmets do. Bright light on the back with 3 settings.
Nice fit. Can wear protective goggles over prescriptions eye glasses. I purchased clear google as my eyeglasses have transitional lenses.
My grandson loves this helmet fits really good. He loves how the visor just snaps on the front of the helmet. Really nice helmet.
"Great fit, straps on both sides are adjustable, there's a safety light with three settings, a sun visor, and more!"
"I ride for pleasure and this helmet has it all. Easy to adjust, a builtin tail light, and a magnetic dark visor. Pretty go ventilation. I love it."
Good cycling helmet unfortunately I ordered the wrong size but looked really cool... will order another size
"I like the construction, the addition features and the adjustable size. Our grandson will be able to enjoy for years"
These are great helmets. They have thought out engineering with users in mind. We own two of these helmets and would definitely recommend them.
My eyes water a lot when hit by wind. The goggles on this helmet completely take care of that problem.
"The bicycle helmet was there but I didn't have to open the box,just reach down and pick up the helmet."
This helmet provided much needed protection when I took a spill on bike path landing on my head.....works great
Just a tad too small but otherwise great! Thankfully I have a Son who needs one and it will be super perfect for him
Great helmet and comfortable stops rain running down but does cause eyes to water in very cold temperature as air sucks up and through over eyes
"Can be easily seen by others both day, dusk, and at night.May seem a little pricey but well worth it with the manitic visor"
Love how light the helmet is and the magnetic removable visor is great for sunlight and preventing bugs to hit your face
"Excellent helmet. I'm very satisfied and I highly recommend. Excellent fit, very lightweight but sturdy. I love the magnetic face shield."
This helmet is so comfortable you barely know it's on your head. Would definitely purchase this again.
Perfect. can't go wrong with this one. Plastic magnetic lenses have some distortion but that would be expected.
The helmet is nice and fits really well. The tightening mechanism is great and the light on the back is a big plus.
Nice cycle helmet. Lightweight and also has a built in light with a cable to charge it. Comfortable and comes in many nice colours
"Not a good fit at all and the seller was not responsive. Unless your head is really big, give it a miss."
I bought this for my husband. He really likes it. Loved the color the weight and style. Great price.
Very comfortable! You can adjust to fit your head just by turning a knob. The light on the back of the helmet adds safety to your ride.
This helmet looks cool with a face mask and is comfortable protecting you're head preventing any serious brain injury
There's so much is comfortable attractive easy to adjust and has all the features you need for a bike helmet.
"Bought it for my wife. She has long hair and She did not complain about anything, she enjoyed wearing it. Wife is happy, I am happy.. :)"
"I love the helmet. First I did was shoot a video of my taking the visors off and saying (Friends) Joey's famous line "" How You Doin?"""
I definitely like the magnetic visor. Visor is very easily installed on and off the helmet. A great quality product. Fits perfectly and comfortably.
I bought the helmet for riding my electric bike. I feel secure with it. It is size adjustable. Good quality
Cycle helmet very good value for money the magnetic detachable visor very useful lightweight and comfortable
Love the magnetic eye shield. I use it instead of my sun glasses because it does a better job at blocking the wind as well.
"Comfortable,practical and ideal with the magnetic glasses and rear lights with multiple setting. Easy and quick to charge"
Totally awesome comfortable lightweight magnetic visor fits over my glasses it is the best helmet I just love it.
Fits perfect I like the visor and it has all the safety pieces all in all you pay for quality and all else that's why I got this helmet
"I bought the helmet for my wife she loved it, it fits nice it looks good and she really liked the visor that's on it cuz it clips on with ease."
"I use on my Segways and Bikes. I've had it for several weeks, and no issues. Light on back works great, too!"
I love the magnetic face shield and the fact that you can get several different colors for night riding etc.
Chin straps a little hard to get adjusted right but all in all very good product Reflector light on helmet last a long time and charges very fast
"The helmet is awesome it has a hair net to keep your hair moisture. I enjoy the comfortable fit, the sun viewer and the rear light for extra safety."
"Very comfortable! I love the look of it!The attachments are easy to connect to the helmet, and they look cool."
Eyeglasses won't fit under the face shield. Otherwise this helmet is lightweight and an outstanding value. It is available in multiple colors.
Looks stylish and og good quality. Pleased with the in- built light and will feel more confident when out cycling.
Helmet was as described. But the information was not clear
"Good product. Instructions could be better but I was able to set it up, size it and get it fitted."
