24-Jan-25,Michelle,"works great.  cute little gadget that works fabulous, especially if you use alot of cooked eggs like we do. the only thing is that you must use the end of the measuring cup to pierce the end of the eggs before cooking them so they don't explode but as i said, works well.  OH, the sound it makes when it's done is very irritating but effective i i must say.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,works great if you use alot of cooked eggs

7-Mar-25,Heidi,Works great! I suggest getting a larger steamer to do more than 4-6 eggs. Steaming for 22 minutes is faster than boiling them and the sheets practically slip off.,5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,
5-Nov-24,Chris,"Works great, simple to use. When your eggs are done I recommend removing the them ASAP and cool  in cold water so they're cooked exactly how you want. If you wait they overcook some from residual heat.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,

6-May-25,Amber,"Worked well the 1st 2 times of use.  After that still cook my eggs but the hole that you poke in the top leaked some of my egg out and onto the base still working with it though.   Like the concept will invest in a more expensive one with a better ""your eggs are done"" alarm the one that comes with this one is annoying.  The eggs still come out perfect peel with ease.  I like my eggs well done and the water line on the cup is the perfect timer.",3 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,For the money.

11-Jul-25,bernadette,"Wish I had found this years ago. No boiling water. Faster than boiling water, cooks to how you want them, 7 eggs at at time or less if you want, shells slid off , you just have to dry the cover when the cooker cools down. So small, fits anywhere in the small box. I have been giving them as a ""just because"" gift for family and friends. Just because they are the best thing I've bought in years and use it at least once a week. It does more than make boiled eggs.The most  important thing to know: READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS. Very simple, but if you don't, you may get a mess. You can cook scrambled, poached. Included are everything you need.  Piercer is on the outside bottom of the measuring cup. Very important. If you love eggs, you'll love  them even more when you use this magic , little appliance.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,

I've only used it twice so far but each time it has cooked my eggs perfectly. 
I love the fact that it doesn't take up a lot of space yet cooks a full 7 eggs at a time which is perfect for a single person. I also love the fact that the buzzer isn't too loud yet loud enough I can hear it from the next room considering I have hearing loss.
In the box you receive an instruction booklet, the cooker base, egg holder insert, measuring cup with egg piercer on the bottom, an egg yolk/white separator, egg bowl, and lid.

There were no gray-green rings around the yolks like I usually get when I boil my eggs.  It saves water by steaming the eggs. There is no running the water to cool eggs down like in the traditional way, just put them in a bowl with cold water for 10 minutes.  I found them easy to peel both times I used this little wonder. I rinsed the removable parts and dried them.  A little vinegar on the heating plate with a tiny bit of rubbing makes it look like new!  The only small drawback is that it only does 7 eggs.  I will have to revert to the traditional way of making hard-boiled eggs for deviled eggs for a get-together.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Egg Cooker Wonder

But I've also made poached eggs and omelets and it's so convenient! I will say, the amount of water is confusing because for a two egg omelet, it says to fill it to medium and my omelet was still pure liquid on the bottom (luckily the tray seems to be microwave safe!), but for just two eggs in the tray, medium cooked them over hard when I was hoping for over easy.

10-Jan-25,Dakota,This egg cooker cooked the eggs as expected.  I needed one in a pinch so I picked this up.  It is very cute and makes 7 eggs.

12-Sep-25,Pamela,"the timer did not make any sound - the omelets are good but cook them longer, or they will be runny - same with cooking time - use it many times to find out how cooked or runny you like your eggs - ease of use is good and there is no alarm in there - the poke hole is too big and does not work. it will crack you egg if you use it the poker hole in the egg hole holder before placing on the plastic screen to cook in. i used more water then said because i wanted hard boiled eggs. also the omelet container will hold quite a large amount of already cooked ingredients if you are cooking eggs. i did not cook a noodle as i do not know what that is and it did not say what that was..",3 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,it was inexpensive and i needed hard boiled eggs

It does not keep the eggs warm throughout the day, and it also DOES NOT TURN ITSELF OFF. I would like it to shut off automatically so that I don't have to stop what I'm doing to go turn off the machine that keeps beeping. The eggs are good after they're cooked.

2-May-25,BigKid,"The MyMini Egg Cooker is okay for hard boiled egg WHITES but, the yolks do not quite cook all the way. I buy large eggs so, I'm basing this review on hard boiling large eggs. I have had some smaller eggs in the large egg carton and they cook a little more thoroughly. Most of us want consistency though and I have to say that I cannot trust the MyMini Egg Cooker to consistently cook the yolks thoroughly. One more thing, there's no timer, just an on/off switch. It comes with a measuring cup that's marked for how much water to use depending on style of eggs you'll be cooking (soft, hard, custard). When the eggs are ready a buzzer alerts you. The buzzer sounds awful and doesn't stop until you flip the off switch.",3 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,

Every egg I cooked was stuck to the egg shell, of the seven eggs none turned out. I had to throw those out.

The buzzer is a high pitch sounding  alarm but it is so faint, I was standing two feet from the device, and didn't realize it was buzzing the completion alarm.

3-Sep-25,A,The first one was returned  because the plastic egg holder was broken. The box was sealed and good condition so it might of been a manufacturing issue. The new one is perfect. It would be nice if the eggs holder was made more durable.,5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,
1-Jun-25,Melski61,"The first issue I had with this is that the bowl that you put your egg into is made of a plastic that melts to the burner even if you run right over and turn it off as soon as the buzzer goes off. I bought a silicone ramekin to use and that solved that problem, but added another $10 to the cost of it.

The last few times I used it, it hasn't cooked the egg fully. Today the buzzer went off, and when I lifted the lid, the egg looked like I had just put it into the ramekin. I had to endure the buzzing about six times before the egg was cooked. And by the way, that buzzer is a horrible noise. It's not a pleasant Ding to let you know it's done. It's more like a smoke alarm going off in your house.

10-Feb-25,anonymous,"The easiest egg you will ever peel.  It comes with a piercing needle which essentially breaks the membrane before cooking which then makes peeling a breeze.  I added water to the hard hoil line and per the instructions it would take 14 minutes, however at about 11 1/2 minutes the buzzer went off indicating the egg was done.  I let it cool and when I cut it open it was more medium boiled, not hard boiled.  I think next time I will add a little bit more water to see if that helps because I don't think just keeping it in for more time will be good for my sanity because the buzzer that goes off is extremely loud and annoying so it needs to be shut off as soon as it goes off 😄.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Has Potential - Water and timing seem off

surprised at how good they came out.  The yolk was cooked perfectly and the egg
whites were not rubbery at all.  Not normally an egg lover, only hard boiled and
scrambled which is really rare when I cook either one of them.  Every time I have
hard boiled, the egg whites come out not soft but a rubbery hard.  The yolks were
usually overcooked.  Definitely am eating more eggs now than I have ever eaten in a
shorter period of time.  So pleased with my purchase and the cost, hard to believe
that something that does such a great job of doing what is is manufactured to do could be so affordable and I do mean affordable.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,One of the best purchases I have made

As for omelettes, it's probably faster and easier to do omelettes on the stove. Usually have to run it through twice for two eggs. I'm also not a fan of all the water that the steam creates in your omelettes. The eggs absorb it, so it's not like you're eggs are soggy, but you can still tell there's water in them. You can squeeze in 4 eggs plus toppings though, when making omelettes.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Perfect for boiled egg lovers

2-Oct-24,Roy,"It's a great way to make hardboiled eggs and they turn out perfect every time!  I also use it to steam shrimp and vegetables.  It's great for making small portions and it's so fast and easy.  Some people complain about the noise the alarm makes but it's really not that bad after all, you aren't buying it for the alarm.  This is kind of like buying a mini-steamer and all you have to do is add water and turn it on.  It's compact and hardly takes up any counter space.  This thing would be great for people who don't have a kitchen at their disposal and even if you have a kitchen it's still an item that saves time and space.  There's no timer - the alarm sounds when the water has been all used up so in essence, the amount of water you add serves as your timer.  I didn't even know that they made things like this - I found it by accident when I was browsing.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.

They can only hold seven eggs if they're regular size so I might be returning it but that's only if I want three eggs at a time  I haven't test anything else out, but when I do, I'll probably updated it and put more pictures but far as I know if you want three eggs at a time then do three eggs but the alarm on it, it's like a annoying buzzer that you'll be able to hear",3 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,"For small eggs, not large"

19-Feb-25,SharonI,"It gives instructions for large or jumbo eggs, but they don't fit!
I put 7 eggs I had in the fridge on the tray %26 the lid would not close around them, there was a gap. 
I wanted them medium, but put enough water for a bit longer than firm. 
Alarm is VERY loud, sounds like a fire alarm inside a building.
When the alarm went off, I put them in a bowl of ice water, as directed, that was covering them up. I set a timer for 10 minutes, and then took one out to break the shell off. 
Before any of the shell could come off once I broke it a bit yolk started to dribble out. It was not cooked at all. 
I then decided to try to cook it for one more round. So I put the remaining six eggs back into the tray, filled it with enough water to cook for hard boil, and covered them with the dome lid, even though it did not set closed completely. 
Again they cooked, I thought, and the alarm went off, very loud again. I took them out and put the tray into the cold ice water bath, and left them for 10 minutes. 
Again, I took one egg, cracked the shell around the outside, and this time I found the weight of the egg was partially cooked, but the yolk inside was intact in a ball. It was very liquidy, and as soon as I pierce the ball liquid yolk came out.
I will be returning this product to Walmart. As it is defective, and does not do the job it is meant to do.

27-Apr-25,Terri,"I ordered this on a whim, truly thinking I would end up returning it, but holy hard boiled eggs, Batman, this thing is AMAZING!  It's so easy to set up and use:
You put the selected amount of water in, pierce your eggs and put them in, cover and press the button. That's it! It has a sensor that reads the amount of water and cooks your eggs to perfection. 
This is definitely a keeper, especially for the price. 
The reason I am giving only four stars is because the cooking area cannot accommodate seven JUMBO eggs; they do not all fit in order to properly close the cover.

I need to start tracking my results so that I can better determine what the perfect amount of water is to cook it to the perfect softness or hardness I'm looking for. it's great to just be able to pop some eggs in there, and a little bit of water and start it and go do my thing. if I was a little more motivated I could actually be making myself breakfast while I'm in the shower while doing virtually nothing to make it happen. however, I do find that the eggs do not peel as well as they do after having been cooked in other units that I have used in the past",3 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,extremely convenient

19-Jul-24,kel,"Easiest AND tastiest way to boil eggs, just choose how done you'd like your eggs boiled (soft, medium or hard), add the amount of water it specifies to add in the included measuring cup — which also doubles as an egg piercing tool that also is super easy to use. Your eggs will cook perfectly every single time,

EAST PEELING HACK:right after you hear the sound of the buzzer going off, your eggs are done (but HOT). Using tongs carefully pick the eggs up and immediately put in ice water (if you're making all six eggs I would use a larger bowl. Lots of ice. THEN — let soak for like a minute, maybe 2. Reach into the water, grab an egg and gently crack it along the inside of your bowl (do this underwater, because the cold water will make your eggs' shells peel right off, effortlessly and without damaging the egg in the process.

11-Feb-25,MrFahrenheit,".... or 6 for that matter.  I could barely fit five large (not extra-large, not jumbo - but large) eggs into the cooker at the same time.  The egg holes in the inserts are too close together.  The plastic cover does not seal around the base of the cooker if you try to put six eggs into the cooker at once.  If there is no seal then the steam escapes and you'll wind up with under-cooked eggs because the steam won't circulate around all the eggs.
I like to cook a dozen eggs for the week so they're ready to go.  If you cook your eggs daily it isn't a big deal.  Otherwise, three stars because it did cook the eggs.

3-Aug-21,Merry,"I returned this product twice! On both products, the timer went off as soon as you turned it on. The first continued to buzz the entire time allotted for cooking. I also wasted the eggs because it didn’t function properly. The second one not only didn’t work, but it didn’t come with the needed piercer. 

Be cautious when purchasing this egg cooker. It’s disappointing to purchase something, it doesn’t work then returning it to only get another one that not only didn’t work, it didn’t have all that was needed to use it!",1 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Don’t waste your time or money!
11-Jan-22,Lisa,"I purchased this for making hard boiled eggs. It works! The eggs are actually easier to peel. I haven't used it for anything else yet however, I plan to. It's cute and takes up very little space. I also liked the inexpensive price of the item. If you don't need to boil a lot of eggs at a time this will work. You can also make soft boiled, scrambled and omelets. I would recommend purchasing this.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Handy egg maker!
7-Dec-20,Mommashark,Love it.  I was skeptical at first but it has exceeded my expectations time and time again.   I have a picky eaters and I use the white tray to cook them eggs and they love them.  I recommend these to everyone I talk to that is looking at them or loves eggs.,5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,"Love, quick,"
22-May-22,Denise,"I have always been hesitant to cook eggs any other way but the way I was taught. So this was a stretch for me. But to my great surprise this little gadget made the best hard boiled eggs I have ever had. Ice I have already tried, but the key is in the puncture of the hole in the eggs. Because of this peeling off the shell was clean and fast and easy. Best $10 bucks spent on a kitchen item.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Perfect every time
14-Feb-22,Lindsay,"I'm obsessed with this! I use it to make hard boiled eggs and they come out perfect and easy to peal every time. So easy to use and convenient!
I also use the dish to make the perfect single serving of steamed vegetables. 
The one negative: just be prepared that the ""chime"" to let you know that it's done cooking is more of a horrible honking noise. Scared me the first time! Now I'm used to it and it's fine, just be aware that it's not some cute ""chime"" sound like the manual says :-)
Price is great, 100% happy with the purchase.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,
28-Jan-24,heytracy13,"I love the color of this little cooker and it's really cute.  I have such little counter space that I needed something small and this fit on my counter with no problem, yet still makes up to 7 eggs at one time.  The directions are pretty straight forward and easy to follow.  The one thing that I didn't realize at first is that the cooking process is timed by the amount of water you add.  That may have been obvious to some but I had to look it up.  The timer went off around the 14 minute mark since I was making hard boiled eggs.  I immediately put them in a bowl of cold water with a few ice cubes and 10 minute later they were cool enough to peel.  I'm not the neatest egg peeler but the shells did come off pretty easily.  I love this thing!  It's easy and much less work than the traditional method.  I haven't used it for other methods, but you can also make soft and medium boiled eggs, omelets, and scrambled eggs.  I may give that a try but will most likely use this for boiled eggs most of the time.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Cute and functional egg cooker

8-Mar-25,Nanc,"Small and mighty! I love just about everything with my mini egg cooker. Only reason I gave 4 stars is that I like my yolk in my hard boiled eggs thoroughly cooked.

Perfect hard boiled eggs, that are easy to peel off the shell!",4 out of 5 stars review,,Small %26 Mighty
12-Mar-24,Barbara,"I liked it yes it took longer than the 14 minutes to hard boil an egg but like with any appliance you have to tweak it. I did it exactly how it said the first time but I just used a couple eggs cuz they didn't want to waste. 14 minutes wasn't quite long enough so I added the water up to the top of the container to the custard setting and did it for 18 minutes and it came out perfect and easy to peel I let him sit in the steamer till it cooled off a minute or two then put it in the ice water for about 10 minutes. I like the fact that it didn't heat my kitchen up living in Oklahoma it gets too hot to begin with so this will work fine, and remember it's $8",4 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,
10-Jun-23,TryingMyBest,"This is a handy little thing! Super easy to use, requires a minimal amount of counter space, and looks adorable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't completely hard boil eggs. Close, but not quite. I'm hoping that just leaving the eggs inside the cooker an extra couple of minutes after shutting it off will do the trick. Either way, it's still well worth the price.",4 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Great little appliance for the money!
18-Dec-23,Mary,Instructions say to poke a small hole in one end of egg with included pin but I don't do it and measure water with included measuring cup and the eggs come out perfect each time.

13-Feb-24,Lea,This makes perfect hard boiled eggs every time and in 17 minutes! I think piercing the shell makes a difference. I had never heard of that but it works! A measuring cup with a pick is included as well as a tray and egg separator. Nifty little appliance! Highly recommend.,5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Love it!
22-Aug-21,Brenna,"This tiny little machine is amazing.  Let’s start off with the tiny countertop Footprint it uses. It’s smaller than a salad plate!  

While I have only used it for whole eggs this far, I have intentions of omelettes and veggies someday when I have a spare minute. 

This makes fantastic soft, medium or hard boiled eggs. You simply use the measure cup (included!) To add the proper amount of water to your egg-doneness (soft/medium/hard). Add it to the tray. Use the needle attached to the cup to pierce a hole in the large end of each egg, then place hole-up in the egg tray.  Plug in the cooker and turn it on. It will beep when they are cooked to perfection. Simply (and carefully!) remove cover and transfer to an ice bath for 10 minutes.  Drain and store in fridge or use as desired.  They peel fantastically easy even from fresh eggs. 

The ease, small footprint and no need for excess water waste is super important to me.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Who knew I’ve always needed this!
27-Sep-23,Ev,"Love my mini egg cooker! Just received it this morning in time to make 7 hard boiled eggs. They were perfect!!! Ate one for breakfast and as I said made perfectly.  Will make egg salad with the other 6. It doesn't just make hard boiled eggs it makes hard, medium,and soft.  It also makes omelets,poached eggs,dumplings,custard and cooks vegetables.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,A very versatile product !
6-May-23,Cheryl,So far I'm really impressed with this purchase. The eggs peel sssoooo much easier than boiled eggs. The only complaint I have it the “chime” it does when it's done. The instructions say it's a chime but more of a horn or something. It's a little obnoxious. But the product works great!,5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Great product!
8-Dec-23,Jeannette,This is a very handy little gadget.  Make boiled eggs quickly or make a personal omelet without the need to take out skillets and make a huge mess on the stove.  I really love it.  Word of caution.   Make sure you read the instructions before using.  Having water in the metal pan is SO important or you will scorch the thing.,4 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Handy and Quick kitchen aide.
10-Nov-23,Susan,"It is very simple to use.  Just  follow the directions and when the eggs  are done an alarm sounds.  No guess, no mess..  The best part is the peeling.  You must put the eggs in ice cold water for at least 15 minutes.  Then the shells come off easily. A friend gave me mine as a gift and I have three wrapped up for Christmas gifts in my closet right now.  For under $10 it's a great gift that takes up very little space in your cupboard.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Great way to make and peel hard boiled eggs!
13-Jan-22,CN,"I love it so far! I used it when I first received it in the mail. Cracked 3 eggs in a bowl, added some ingredients for an omelet and then followed the directions in the manual. I like my eggs cooked with no runny egg and I like my omelets to be cooked all the way through. I used the suggested “medium level” first. Omelet was almost completely firm but not quite. I ran it through on another medium cycle and it was firm after that and delicious!

Next, I tried testing out the boiled egg feature and I used 3 eggs. I pierced the holes in the larger end (located on the bottom of the measuring cup) and filled it to “hard boiled”. When the timer went off, I put the eggs in a cold ice water bath for 10 mins. Let me just say that peeling these eggs were so easy it felt like a prank. The eggs were perfect with no egg white sticking to the shell. The only downside was that the yolk was still not to my liking but next time I will use a little more water and time. This machine is otherwise a blessing and I love it!",4 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Cannot Beat a Better Deal (Pun Intended)!
7-Aug-23,Aynsley,This is the little mini maker that could! Hard boiled eggs come out perfect. Easy to peel. And cleaning the pieces are a cinch. Only reason I gave 4 starts is because of the wretched noise the alarm makes when eggs are ready. It sounds like my fire alarm. Scared the heck out of all of us until we realized it was the egg maker. So my ONLY suggestion is you replace the siren with a soft “ding”. :),4 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Great little egg maker! But beware the siren!
3-Sep-23,Audry,I got a used egg cooker. It was even still dirty with egg on it. Seems to be a returned item because it also makes a horrible screeching noise when the eggs are done. It's terrible but I got it on sale for $8 and I really need it for my kid so don't have time to return this one and wait for another.,2 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Buy from another brand
28-Jan-24,Suzi,This device works so well. The instructions are perfect. Works like a charm! Also the eggs are easier to peel than boiling the conventional way. Just beware- the alarm is SO LOUD when it is done cooking. It sounds like a fire truck. I find myself trying to beat it every time.,5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Fantastic egg cooker!
28-Aug-23,Gel,This little gadget is a gamechanger! I dont have the patience to boil eggs and I feel like I get a different result each time I attempt it. This egg cooker is so easy to use and is so efficient. It will cook eggs in 7 minutes! It eliminates waiting on water to boil and you will have eggs cooked to your preference as it has 3 modes and will alert you when it's done. Where has this been all my life?!,5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Where has this been all my life?!
4-Aug-21,KYCM,"I've used this product 3 times now to make hard boiled eggs. I followed the directions and within minutes had perfectly cooked, easy to peel, hard boiled eggs. The price is great, and the product takes up very little space.  I haven't tried to cook other types of eggs in it yet so can't speak on how well it cooks those, but I am very pleased with it so far. I hope it continues to work for a long time.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Happy with my purchase
23-May-23,Gina,"This egg cooker “boils” eggs perfectly!  Holds up to 7 eggs and simple to use.  Add the recommended amount of water, poke a pin hole in the egg with the provided tool, turn it on and walk away.  The end “chime” is more of a loud buzz.  Ya can't miss it!   lol",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,I love this thing!
14-Aug-23,Ginny,"Works great and the eggs peel so easily! I love that it's small enough to easily fit on my counter without having to move anything plus it's much more energy efficient than firing up the stove.

10-Oct-23,Erika,"So, this little egg cooker saves the day more than I'd like to imagine. I am a mom of 4 boys, a student, and I work full time. My eldest loves boiled eggs.

Definitely recommend!",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Busy Mom of toddlers to teens approved

6-Sep-23,Stephen,"I just bought this and used it today. I put about 4fl oz of water into it and then put the  7 eggs in. I skipped poking a hole in the end of the eggs. Steamed for 14 minutes, removed and let cool for 15 minutes at room temperature. The eggs peeled and came out great. 14 Deviled eggs in 30 minutes!

It doesn't require a large amount of water so it saves water. The eggs are very easy to peel which is a big plus.  I don't have to keep watching the time the eggs need to be cooked. It lets me know when the eggs are done. It can also be used to steam dim sum, make an omelet and other things.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Real handy

20-Nov-21,Janeh,Works great!  Very happy with my purchase.  Plan to get one for a gift.  Eggs come out perfectly and it's nice to get HB eggs in the hot summer and not have to have a pot of water boiling.  Tried using it for T. Joe's dumplings also.  Worked great.  Also makes wonderful soft cooked eggs.  Respect the hotplate part.  This is not a toy.  I add a couple drops more water than required.

22-Nov-23,MoovieLuver,"I like the concept of cooking eggs. Deal breaker which made me return this product was the awful frightening sound like an alarm was going off in the house. Which was the product when eggs were done.  Not like the other brand that plays a melody.  I also didn't care for the handle at the top when lifting very cheaply designed. If you could improve sound then, I would give this product a four star for the price.",1 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Honest
23-Apr-23,Kat,"Includes steamer, egg rack, poaching/ 'omelet' pan, measuring cup with piercer, lid, yolk/white separator. I'm currently disabled with only one functioning hand and this little appliance is great. 7 large eggs, hard cooked to perfection, easy and quick.  They have a tool to pierce the eggs, but I've steamed eggs in a pot for years and never pierced, so I don't do that and have yet to have one explode on me. I clean the plate with a bit of white vinegar after each use and it does it's job wonderfully. The hardest part is peeling them, but I drop the finished eggs in ice water for 10/15 minutes and the generally peel fine.  No green tinged, dry yolks. I haven't tried soft cooked in the shell, but a poached egg made in the little cooking pan provided was good. Recommended.",5 out of 5 stars review,Verified Purchase,Great little egg steamer.

2-Nov-24,HavenHealer,"A really great kitchen appliance.  I use this thing ALL the time!  Cooks up to 7 eggs at a time, soft, medium, or hard boiled.  But my favorite feature is ability to make fluffy 3-egg omelettes/scrambled eggs.  Do the following, all in the omelette bowl that comes with it.  Beat with fork 3 large eggs.  Salt, pepper, garlic powder.  1/4 cup milk, cream or 1/2 %26 1/2 mixed in (optional).  1/3 cup shredded cheese (optional).  Fill water reservoir completely full.  Cook through one cycle till (loud!) alarm goes off.  Dump into a cereal bowl and mix in well the still-liquid part with the cooked part.  Then dump all back into omelette bowl.  Fill reservoir again, and run through another cycle.  You can eat out of the omelette bowl. or dump onto plate or back into cereal bowl.  NOTE:  If you use only 2 eggs and/or don't add cheese, you can probably do this in one cycle.  Another idea is to use yolk only for 1-2 of the eggs for shorter cooking time.

18-May-24,Kimberly,Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this little egg cooker. It's been used a few times a week now for five months with always perfectly cooked eggs using their cup/instructions. We also make a three egg “omelet” in their included plastic pan that fluffs up huge tho it does take double time to cook due to how much we put in it. Still it cooks it perfectly tho all the heavier ingredients always sinks to bottom of the pan. Keeping it clean is easy and the “buzzer” noise notifying when eggs are done aka water has steamed out is extremely loud which is great for us in a big house where we often walk away from kitchen while things are cooking. So we easily hear when it's done and never worry about leaving it turned on when it's out of water. Just a great inexpensive egg cooker that works perfectly.,5 out of 5 stars review,,Great little egg cooker at any price

My only complaint is the ""chime"" that lets you know when the eggs are ready. You dont have to worry about not hearing it as it sounds alot like a smokealarm going off! I didnt see the alarm mentioned in the comments before buying and its volume is something to be aware of. I make sure to get to it before the alarm goes off, its otherwise a really good egg cooker!",4 out of 5 stars review,,"Cute and Compact, but a loud alarm!"
18-Dec-20,Brian,"I was skeptical about this, especially considering how inexpensive it is. I've used it four times now, and I've had zero issues, each time. (For those who said theirs beeped, incessantly, upon plugging it in, I don't know what to tell you. Mine didn't do that.)

The cooker uses a miniscule amount of water, and it hard ""boils"" the eggs in only 14 minutes, whether it's cooking 1-7 eggs. They have come out perfectly cooked, each time!

Some things to consider:

- Capacity is seven ""large or smaller size eggs"". I have only used jumbo size eggs. Per the instructions, the sides of the eggs aren't supposed to touch, but with six jumbo eggs, that's impossible, once you place the dome lid on top. I don't think you could even fit seven jumbo eggs in it. I've made six, but not seven, at a time, and the sides were touching each time. The world didn't end, so that's that. 

- You pierce the wider end of the egg with the spike, that's on the bottom of the measuring cup and place them thin side down, on the tray. When done, every egg has had a flat side, on the egg whites. No big deal if you're simply going to eat them. If you're going for aesthetics, it's something to think about.

- Instructions say 14 minutes cook time for hard boiled, but for jumbo eggs, it's closer to 15 or even 16 minutes. You're mileage may vary. 

- I have no idea how loud the chime is, when it's finished, as I set the oven timer to go off anyway.

- I have used neither the egg separator, nor the omelet tray. They may work. They may be junk. I do not know. 

Yes, the thing may break tomorrow, but at $9, it's no big deal. I'll simply go by another one. With that said, I can't see how you'll be disappointed, if you go buy one, for yourself. Do it!",5 out of 5 stars review,,On the fence? Don't be. Go get one of these!
1-Dec-20,Leonid,"I am ravenous and just barely got home. Hmmm, I think I want a medium boiled egg or two with a cup of hot tea. Where’s that little teal kitchen gizmo that probably won’t work but I will try anyway that I picked up at Walmart on my way home?

Right... find the tiny cup, fill it to medium, pour that into the cooking plate, place the egg tray on top, use the same cup to pierce a couple of eggs, close the lid, press button, wait until it beeps...

It can’t be that easy, right? I just cooked two jumbo eggs faster than the manual indicated. After I peeled them, they were precisely medium done in beautiful orange color. After it was done, there were a couple of drops on water remaining on the cooking surface. Do you know what that means? NO CLEANING!!! :)

This thing is easier than microwaving eggs. It also doubles as a vegetable steamer as it cooks with steam.",5 out of 5 stars review,,So yummy!

The bad, the alarm is an annoying buzzer, not pleasant at all.  Otherwise, functions well, as I expected and I look forward to trying a few other things as the cleanup is very easy.  A word of advice, don't forget to puncture the large part of the egg with the needle in the bottom of the water measuring cup and then when eggs are in the water bath to cool, break the shells under water by rolling against the bottom/side of bowel and the shell will almost fall away.",4 out of 5 stars review,,Quick and easy

I don't like that you have to poke the eggs. It wasn't something that was really clear before I bought it. But at least it comes with a poker and if you lost it you could use a needle. I would use it more if it wasn't for that step.
Also, it doesn't auto shut off and the noise is super annoying. You pretty much gotta wait nearby or everyone in your house will scream until the awful noise stops. If you live in an apartment, like me, you will have to wait nearby or risk the wrath of your neighbors to all sides.

The shell comes right off, without even the tiniest piece of egg still attached. That's a big deal to me, because deviled eggs are all about presentation. And the eggs are not dry or overcooked.

14-Apr-25,Shannon,Works perfectly and you get perfectly cooked eggs with easy to remove shells. My only issue is with the alarm that goes off when they are done cooking.  It is very loud and startled my whole family the first time I tried it. Sounds more like an emergency alarm than an alarm for food but you'd definitely hear it from across your house and not forget to turn it off which may be the point. I wouldn't use it while kids or spouses are taking a nap.,,"Cooks eggs great, especially for the price!",
18-Nov-25,TrayTre1,Cute idea works well in the sense that everything was hard boiled but you have to poke holes in each egg before putting it in there with the little needle it comes with. A lot of prep work for something I could've thrown in a pot and boiled.,Walmart Associate,,
24-Jun-25,Susan,I did follow the instructions. I pierce the egg I cooked it with the right amount of water for the allotted amount of time and it came out not hard boiled but extremely soft boiled. I decided to return it. I gave it a shot and it didn't live up.,,,

To get around this I've started putting the max amount of water in it then just setting a timer for the length of time I need to cook the eggs how I want them.

23-Oct-24,Maureen,"I ended up returning the egg cooker because it takes 14 minutes to cook plus another 10 minutes to cool down in an ice bath.

29-Mar-24,Becky,"I've had my egg cooker for two years bought this one from my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it in two years. I have never had an egg that wouldn't peel they practically fall out of the shell. I would replace this, if anything ever happened to it.",,Quick and easy,
13-Apr-24,Chris,"Positive - Has little tool to pierce egg prior to steaming that also helps pick up egg to move to ice bath. Alarm when steaming complete. Cooks up to 7 eggs perfectly. 

Negative - Used recommended amount of water, but it steamed out and the bottom scorched on first use. 

Overall - Use when you need to hard boil a ton of eggs, but not an every day tool.",,Totally Happy!!!,
3-Jun-24,Valerie,"I was looking for an unrelated product and saw this. I can cook eggs on the stove just fine but I love soft and hardboiled eggs and hate cooking them. 

I have used this without any issue probably 2 dozen times since I got it. It cooks my eggs perfectly and now I have my favorite kind of eggs all the time.",,Quick and easy,
19-Jul-24,kel,"Easiest AND tastiest way to boil eggs, just choose how done you'd like your eggs boiled (soft, medium or hard), add the amount of water it specifies to add in the included measuring cup — which also doubles as an egg piercing tool that also is super easy to use. Your eggs will cook perfectly every single time,

EAST PEELING HACK:right after you hear the sound of the buzzer going off, your eggs are done (but HOT). Using tongs carefully pick the eggs up and immediately put in ice water (if you're making all six eggs I would use a larger bowl. Lots of ice. THEN — let soak for like a minute, maybe 2. Reach into the water, grab an egg and gently crack it along the inside of your bowl (do this underwater, because the cold water will make your eggs' shells peel right off, effortlessly and without damaging the egg in the process.

7-Aug-23,Aynsley,This is the little mini maker that could! Hard boiled eggs come out perfect. Easy to peel. And cleaning the pieces are a cinch. Only reason I gave 4 starts is because of the wretched noise the alarm makes when eggs are ready. It sounds like my fire alarm. Scared the heck out of all of us until we realized it was the egg maker. So my ONLY suggestion is you replace the siren with a soft “ding”. :),,Buy this!,

I make egg salad, deviled eggs, and plain hard-boiled eggs for the family as a meal prep once a week, and I no longer dread the process. The timer is very loud, so you'll k ow when it's done. It's a crazy-sounding buzzer at that.",,Awesome Egg Cooker,
18-Mar-24,Rosa,"This is fantastic for making hard boiled eggs.  Just pour in the water for the desired egg cook, flip the switch to “On”, and the egg cooker does the rest.  A buzzer goes off when they're done. I poured in water for hard boiled eggs, and they came out perfect, just perfect.  The yolk was hard boiled but no green ring, just yellow and delicious.  It has a tiny pin on the bottom of the water cup that is to be used to pierce the egg to keep the egg from exploding.  I only boiled two eggs the first time to test it out to see if it really worked.  I pierced one egg, but not the other one, they both came out perfectly, no cracks, no explosion.  I plan on using the included bowl to make omelets, and steam vegetables.

15-Mar-21,Pamela,"This is a great little unit for the price. I bought it for my RV and its a great addition. My only negative is that it is inconsistent. One day the egg is done, the next day it seems to cook fewer minutes and the egg is not done.  The trick is to know the time needed and leave the egg in the cooker if the beeper sounds too soon. Just set a timer to get consistent egg results.",,Quick and Easy,

I'm very happy with my purchase. Perfect for forms or those with no kitchen. You can make other things too but I have not gone that far.,,eggsxelent perfection,
24-May-22,Gladys,"Will not buy a third egg cooker, or at least not this brand. I bought 2 of these, at 2 different times of course. Followed the instructions to a T, put the eggs in, plugged it in, turned it on, and after about a minute, this very loud annoying chime would sound off. Oh, and eggs were not cooked.",,Makes Peeling Easy!!!,
23-Sep-20,GatorGirl0824,"I've tried every way to cook hard boiled eggs, and still the shell would stick, or the yoke would have a green haze to it. NOT ANY MORE!! This little $9 gadget has changed my egg game. Not only were they cooked perfectly,  but the shell slid off, and the yoke was a beautiful creamy yellow color. So worth the few bucks!",,Great little egg cooker!,
21-May-22,John,"This is what I wanted, and the price was great.  I don't need it to make omelettes, or scrambled eggs, or soft boiled or poached eggs, or fix the national debt.  I just want it to hard boil eggs, which it does perfectly.
However, I did discover that if I put the drip coffee maker filter basket in it (sitting on the egg cradle), it also steams veggies nicely.  So far I've tried carrots, peas, and Brussels sprouts, and they came out great - much better than boiling in water.  It can do a potato, but it takes roughly 3 water refill cycles to cook it through.",,Absolutely Eggsellent!,
4-May-24,Londa,It was a Christmas gift for my son and his wife. They loved it.,,Started burning eggs after three uses.,
16-Oct-24,YG,Its really helpful.,,mini egg steamer,
27-Jan-22,KN,Cooked my egg to perfection!  Very annoying that the timer goes off at the 10 minute soft boiled setting and you can’t turn it off or adjust.  I had to listen to it chime for the last 5 minutes of the cooking to get my egg at hard boiled.,,Just what I needed.,
22-Feb-22,Susan,"Wore out my old egg cooker, needed a new one fast and this was the only cooker in town.  It is junk.  Will not hold larger eggs, does not cook hard boiled and leaks water as it is cooking.  I want my old one back.",,How not to use!,
