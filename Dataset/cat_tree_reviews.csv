- Looks nice.
- Lots of nooks and crannies.
- Fuzzy texture.
- Probably great for kittens.

CONS:
- A lot of work to assemble.
- Some of the corners and platforms are really tight for a full grown cat.

THOUGHTS:
I think this item would have been great for my cat back when she was still a kitten.  The way some of the platforms and openings are arranged seem weird to me, like they're a bit tricky to navigate.  When I first put this together, my cat acted like she would love it.  But after a while, I noticed that she seemed to have trouble navigating some of the corners, platforms, and openings.  I think it's made her not really like it as much as she would have if she were a bit smaller.","(0)","Great for kittens, not so much for full grown cats"

We decided to buy a new one instead of trying to replace the rope, thinking it would be the easier way to go.

This cat tree was almost impossible to set up (with 2 people it took about 45 minutes) due to very poor quality control.  The holes in the wood do not line up with the holes in the carpeting, and trying to get some of the riser poles in place was very difficult.  We had to cut the carpeting, and fight with the poor execution of what looked like a good design.  

There are openings for the cats to go into the ""houses"", but the larger house has no platform under the openig to get in.  The cats can make the jump, but it is not a very friendly way for them to do it. The grommets on the strap used to keep it from tipping fell out of the strap when the screw was going into the wall.  If that is the quality of the rest of the piece, we will be buying a new cat tree sooner than we expected to.

Save yourself the frustration and find another cat tree that was actually designed with the cats and the assemblers in mind.  This one is headed to the garbage in short order, based on how the unit was so poorly designed.","(0)","Terrible assembly experience - poor design"

"Feb 11, 2024","Andrea","","","","Sold by","Factory Direct Wholesales, LLC","","","2 out of 5 stars review","Verified Purchase","The quality, stability, and overall durability of this cat tower leave much to be desired. I was hopeful based on previous reviews I had read but it definitely didn't live up to the hype. The carpeted fabric is very low quality and was pilling and shedding all over the place before we even had the pieces fully unwrapped and out of the box. I hoped maybe a good vacuuming would help but the cat tree sheds almost worse than my cats do. In addition, the fabric is so thin, particularly around the cubby sections, that you can actually see the particle board showing through in one spot or another on pretty much every level of the tower. The cats can see eachother throughout the walls of the condo because so much light shines through the thin balding material. Ultimately I figured the cats would probably scratch up a climbing tower pretty good but honestly, I doubt this thing will last long enough for the cats to actually get the intended amount of use from it. In addition to the shoddy material, the stability of this tower is questionable at best. I don't even mean it's unstable due to the height or lack of a wall mount. I mean, each pedestal wobbles even after every piece was tightened and balanced according to instructions. I have 4 cats varying in size from 7lbs to 14lbs. I expected this tower to withstand the weight of each individual cat and hoped at least 2 of them could safely use it at the same time. As it turns out, my 7lb kitten is almost too heavy to use the tower by himself. All 3 of the pedestals wobbles when he sits on them and if he jumps or climbs with any force the trunks of the pedestals actually look like they bow. One of the pieces is already coming loose and can't even be tightened because the board around the bolts is wearing away after only about a week of light use. The fully assembled tower is rickety and easily tips off balance when my two smallest cats (7lbs and 8lbs) play together. My long 12lb Tom Cat almost knocks the entire cat tree over when he attempts to jump from the floor onto one of the platforms. We have it propped in a corner so there are 2 walls to support the climber because it is not at all stable enough to be safe without some supplemental support and added structure to hold the base in place and catch the tower when it starts to lean or tip from the momentum of the cats jumping onto it. They haven't used it during a full energy spastic play session because I'm positive it will either crumble in spots or topple over on top of one of them as another hangs on for dear life. Basically, it looks like fun but completely lacks the durability and stability to be functional for what it is intended. Save yourself the time and money and skip this product because it takes longer to assemble than it's going to get used before falling apart!","(0)","Highly Disappointing Quality All Around"
